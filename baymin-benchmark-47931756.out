With this evidence the posterior probability of node **B** is:

```

The original (prior) distribution was:

```
P(B = False) = 0.2652

**Effect on belief in B**

* The belief that B is **False** decreased by 0.2565.

  P(E1=False) = 0.6204
  P(E1=True) = 0.3796

Original distribution:
  P(E1=False) = 0.2776
  P(E1=True) = 0.7224

Conclusion:
  Belief in 'False' increased by 0.3427
  Belief in 'True' decreased by 0.3427

ans:
 According to the tool’s output, the probability distribution for E1 is:

- P(E1 = False) = 0.2776  
- P(E1 = True) = 0.7224  

Since the probability of E1 = True is higher, the most likely value of E1 is True.
