First, I remember that in Bayesian networks, conditioning on certain nodes can block paths and make nodes d-separated. Previously, the user tried using the get_evidences_block_two_nodes tool, which returned that there are no evidences to block B1 and G. Then, they used check_common_cause and found that P, N, U are common causes. Condition","When conditioning, what nodes would close all open paths between B1 and G? -------------------------------- A.

Observing P would block the dependency. But the user is reminding me to use tools again if possible.
