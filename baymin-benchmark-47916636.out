Conclusion:
  Belief in 'False' decreased by 0.2101
  Belief in 'True' increased by 0.2101
  Largest overall per-state shift: 0.2101.
Evidence impact (leave-one-out):
  - I: L1=0.4408, max_abs=0.2204
  - F: L1=0.0417, max_abs=0.0209
  => Most influential evidence: I (by L1 contribution).

[BayMin Testing] Response time: 28.23s, Quiz time: 58.24s, Total: 86.48s
quiz:
 Could knowing F, J, C, A, B, D, I make an indirect path appear between H and E?
--------------------------------
A. Yes - conditioning on F, J, C, A, B, D, I changes the dependency between H and E. Before observing F, J, C, A, B, D, I, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they are d-separated. This happens because the path from H to E goes through F as a chain. Observing F blocks the chain: H → I → E.
--------------------------------
B. Yes - conditioning on F, J, C, A, B, D, I changes the dependency between H and E. Before observing F, J, C, A, B, D, I, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they are d-separated. This happens because the path from H to E is a common effect (collider) of F as a chain. Observing F opens the path: H → I → E.
--------------------------------
C. No - conditioning on F, J, C, A, B, D, I does not change the dependency between H and E. Before observing F, J, C, A, B, D, I, they were d-separated. After observing all evidence, they remain d-connected.
--------------------------------
D. None of the above
y:
 A
y_hat:
 D
---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 According to the tool’s output, conditioning on F, J, C, A, B, D, I changes the dependency between H and E. Before observing these nodes they were d-connected, but after observing all of them they become d-separated. Thus, knowing these variables does not make an indirect path appear between H and E; it actually blocks the existing path.

quiz:
 Is changing the evidence of W going to change the probability of R?
--------------------------------
A. Yes, W is d-connected to R, which means that entering evidence for W would change the probability of R and vice versa. They d-connected through the following path: ['W', 'A', 'X', 'R']
--------------------------------
B. Yes, they are d-connected through the path E, L, D1, U. Meaning that changing the evidence of W will change the probability of R.
--------------------------------
C. None of the above
--------------------------------
D. No, there is no path between W and R. Meaning that changing the evidence of W will not change the probability of R.

---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 P(Y | U=True, X=True):
  P(Y=False) = 0.4739
  P(Y=True) = 0.5261

Original distribution:
  P(Y=False) = 0.4604
  P(Y=True) = 0.5396

Conclusion:
  Overall, the update is minimal (all changes ≤ threshold).

Evidence impact (leave-one-out):
  - U: L1=0.0364, max_abs=0.0182
  - X: L1=0.0098, max_abs=0.0049
  => Most influential evidence: U (by L1 contribution).

 To d-separate C and D1 you must condition on every common cause that lies on a path between them.  
The common causes are:

P, X, D, A, T, N, A1, G, M, J, H, W, U

Adding evidence (i.e., observing a value) for each of these nodes will block all paths and make C and D1 independent.

quiz:
 Can information flow from K to A1 through knowing M, A, V?
--------------------------------
A. No - conditioning on M, A, V does not change the dependency between K and A1. Before observing M, A, V, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they remain d-connected.
--------------------------------
B. No - conditioning on M, A, V does not change the dependency between K and A1. Before observing M, A, V, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they remain d-connected.
--------------------------------
C. Yes - conditioning on M, A, V changes the dependency between K and A1. Before observing M, A, V, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they are d-separated.
--------------------------------
D. None of the above
y:
 A
y_hat:
 D
---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 Yes.  
The tool check_d_connected confirms that K and A1 are d-connected via the path `['K', 'Z', 'A1']`.  
The tool check_evidences_change_relationship_between_two_nodes shows that conditioning on M, A, and V does not alter this relationship – they remain d-connected.  
Therefore, information can still flow from K to A1 even when you know the states of M, A, and V.

--------------------------------
A. No - conditioning on T, I, A, M, Y, G, V, C, P, N, Z, B1, H, R, K, U, W, L, D1, B, Q, F does not change the dependency between X and A1. Before observing T, I, A, M, Y, G, V, C, P, N, Z, B1, H, R, K, U, W, L, D1, B, Q, F, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they remain d-connected.

---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 Yes, A1 is reachable from X. The tool result shows that X is d-connected to A1 through the path \['X', 'U', 'A1'\], and conditioning on the listed evidence (T, I, A, M, Y, G, V, C, P, N, Z, B1, H, R, K, U, W, L, D1, B, Q, F) does not change this dependency. Thus, A1 remains reachable from X.

--------------------------------
A. Yes - conditioning on U, F, J, A, D, A1, T, S, N, O, H, Z, M, L, C, V, R, C1, X, Q, W, B, D1, G, I changes the dependency between B1 and P.

This happens because the path from B1 to P goes through T as a chain. Observing T blocks the chain: B1 → C1 → P.
--------------------------------
B. Yes - conditioning on U, F, J, A, D, A1, T, S, N, O, H, Z, M, L, C, V, R, C1, X, Q, W, B, D1, G, I changes the dependency between B1 and P.

[BayMin Testing] Response time: 34.55s, Quiz time: 49.11s, Total: 83.65s
quiz:
 Is T independent of A?
--------------------------------
A. No, T is not d-connected to A, so evidence on T would not change the probability of A. They are blocked at {'D2', 'C', 'I1', 'D1', 'H2', 'B2', 'V', 'A2', 'M', 'Q', 'S', 'I', 'J', 'B1', 'L1', 'E2', 'B', 'C2', 'R1', 'L', 'G2', 'X', 'E', 'F2', 'R', 'Y', 'K', 'H', 'H1'} due to the common effects.
--------------------------------
B. No, they are d-separated because they are blocked by F2, E2, B, E, L1, J, Q, W1, C, M, D2, X, G2, D1, A2, L, H, R1, B1, B2, S, H1, R, C2, I1, Y, V, K, I. Meaning that changing the evidence of T will not change the probability of A.
--------------------------------
C. None of the above
--------------------------------
D. Yes, they are d-connected. Meaning that changing the evidence of T will change the probability of A.
y:
 A
y_hat:
 B
---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 Yes, T is independent of A. The `check_d_connected` tool indicates that T and A are not d-connected, meaning evidence on T would not change the probability of A. Additionally, the `check_common_cause` tool confirms that there is no common cause between T and A.

quiz:
 Is S reachable from R1?
--------------------------------
A. Yes, R1 is d-connected to S, which means that entering evidence for R1 would change the probability of S and vice versa. They d-connected through the following path: ['R1', 'Z', 'N', 'S']
--------------------------------
B. Yes, they are d-connected through the path H2, V, A2, C1. Meaning that changing the evidence of R1 will change the probability of S.
--------------------------------
C. None of the above
--------------------------------
D. No, there is no path between R1 and S. Meaning that changing the evidence of R1 will not change the probability of S.
y:
 A

---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 Yes, S is reachable from R1. The tool result states: “No evidence provided. Relationship between R1 and S is d-connected with no conditioning.” This indicates that, without any conditioning evidence, the two nodes are d-connected and thus reachable.

[BayMin Testing] Response time: 60.65s, Quiz time: 11.30s, Total: 71.95s
quiz:
 What is the downstream effect of both C1 and M1?
--------------------------------
A. The common effects of C1 and M1 are: Y, R1, G2.
--------------------------------
B. The common effects of C1 and M1 are: R1, J1, Y.
--------------------------------
C. No, there is no common effect between C1 and M1.
--------------------------------
D. None of the above
y:
 A
y_hat:
 D
---------------------------------------------
Baymin Model:
ans:
 The joint evidence that C1 = True and M1 = True slightly shifts the probability of the downstream node O:

- P(O = True | C1 = True, M1 = True) = 0.4461  
- P(O = False | C1 = True, M1 = True) = 0.5539

Compared with the prior distribution (P(O = True) = 0.4497, P(O = False) = 0.5503), the update is minimal—each change is below the typical threshold. The most influential evidence in this update is C1.
