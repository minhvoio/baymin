      "A hybrid project management methodology will be employed, It will combine the Waterfall method's order and documentation for the initial scope defining sessions and budget discussions with Agile's iterative approach during the development sprints and user testing. The clients prefer this approach and users will appreciate the predictability the method will provide in the app development schedule while still allowing for responsive adaptation after user feedback. Major activities to be completed in the project include development sprints every two weeks, feedback collection from stakeholders as per project milestones, and risk evaluation after every project stage.\n",

      "- **Project Manager:** Oversees the development team and has a stronger influence and interest in the outcome of the project as the result will impact them more.\n",
      "- **Lifeloop Executive Team:** Cares a lot about the outcome of the project, has a much less direct role than the project manager but the app is still tailored around their general specifications.\n",

      "the Hays Technology Contractor Rates Guide to understand the specific roles and their associated costs required to develop the LoopCare application. This methodology was used in conjunction with a parametric estimation. For labour, we estimated the number of hours required based on the WBS and gantt chart to determine the required personnel and how long they would be needed to complete their portion of the project. This hybrid cost estimation methodology has helped us ensure realistic and justifiable costs for the LoopCare app development project.\n",

      "#### <span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>**Justifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Labour Rates**: Based on Hays Contractor Guide 2024 and Monash guidelines. Roles included Project Manager (\\$100/hr), AI Engineer (\\$75/hr), UX/UI Designer (\\$94/hr), Marketing Specialist (\\$50/hr), and QA Tester. These rates ensure a realistic and up to date Australian market salaries for the given roles. The hours were estimated by linking them directly to the WBS and the Gantt Chart, where each task's duration has been mapped to scope deliverables. Therefore, the hours estimated aligns directly with the scope and task complexity (Hays, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Material Costs**: Hardware and software costs were estimated using parametric estimation (unit price). Prices for the devices, servers and licenses were taken from the official vendors' websites. Vendor selections (such as Windows for OS, Figma, MS SQL Server Standard Edition, MSI Prestige 16 PCs etc…) were based on compatibility with app development requirements, performance, durability and cost efficiency. We also considered industry standards and long term support to carry out the app development project smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Services**: External usability testing, automated testing tools and security audits were priced using analogous estimation based on comparable app development projects at Monash and industry benchmark. These were selected based on reputation, reliability and strategic fit for the project's development requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Training & Support**: Staff onboarding calculated with hourly rates. Training platforms such as [connecteam.com](http://connecteam.com) were used to provide an extra support, helping improve the team efficiency during deployment as well as maintenance phases of the LoopCare App.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contingency**: A 15% buffer was added to cover possible risks such as delays or supply issues. This percentage was chosen based on the project's risk exposure and to avoid potential budget fluctuations due to updates in the project's scope and market uncertainties, aligning with PMI guidance for contingency (England & Moreci, 2012). Therefore, this provides a realistic safety margin without making the budget unnecessarily high.\n",

      "#### **R04 - Application rejected by Apple App Store or Google Play Store (15):**\n",
      "\n",
      "This risk is classified as the highest level because its potential impact is catastrophic. If the application is rejected by Apple or Google, users will be unable to download or use the product, leading to the failure of the entire project. Although the probability of occurrence is moderate, the consequences are unacceptable, so this is the primary concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **R09 - Conflicts among team members (15):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal team conflicts are a potential but serious threat. Inadequate communication or unresolved disputes may lead to delays in the delivery of results and a decline in morale. Given the collaborative nature of software development, this risk is equally important as the risk of the application being rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **R08 - Artificial Intelligence Not Operating as Expected (12):**\n",
      "\n",
      "As this application heavily relies on artificial intelligence functions, any inaccuracies or deviations in the results could undermine user trust and damage the product's reputation. Given that trust is a key factor for users to adopt, this risk is considered very high. The likelihood of the problem occurring is moderate, but its relevance to customer retention makes it an important concern.\n",

      "#### **R06 - Budget issues caused by underestimation (10):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceeding the budget limit may lead to dissatisfaction from stakeholders and result in project delays. However, through strict cost monitoring, this risk can be effectively controlled.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although marketing challenges will not prevent the release of the application, they will directly affect the product's exposure and user acceptance. A well-crafted product that does not have effective marketing strategies may not be able to attract users, so this risk is placed above purely technical flaws.\n",

      "\n",
      "Both of these risks can lead to project delays, but they can be controlled through quality assurance, comprehensive testing, and diversification of suppliers. They are destructive but controllable, and therefore fall into the medium-priority category.\n",

      "To demonstrate the significance of proactive risk management, the three highest-priority risks (R04, R08, R09) were evaluated in terms of potential time delays and financial impacts. This analysis took into account both direct costs and indirect costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **R04 - Application rejected by Apple App Store or Google Play Store:**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Time impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "If the app has been rejected by Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the development team would need to rework compliance related issues, resubmit the application, and wait through another review circle. This resubmission process could delay the official launch by approximately four to six weeks. Such a delay would disrupt carefully scheduled marketing campaigns and slow down customers on boarding and users' feedback collection. Both are critical to improve the app during its early lifecycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Cost impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional development work required to meet compliance requirements may cost between \\$20,000 and \\$30,000. The project will also face the risk of losing revenue opportunities, as each week of delay in going to market will postpone the market entry time and reduce the available time to attract early adopters. Moreover, a failed first submission may reduce the confidence of stakeholders in the project team, thereby causing reputational pressure. Overall, this risk may result in a total financial burden of \\$40,000 to \\$60,000 and the consequences of delayed market entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **R08 - Artificial Intelligence Not Operating as Expected:**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Time impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The artificial intelligence function is the core differentiating factor of this application, which means that any malfunction of this component would cause significant damage. If the results generated by the artificial intelligence are inaccurate, biased, or unreliable, additional testing and re-training cycles will be required, each of which will extend the development time by approximately two to three weeks. These delays not only slow down the integration process of artificial intelligence with other application functions, but also create dependencies, thereby interfering with the broader system development work.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Cost impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct costs include implementing the artificial intelligence verification framework, purchasing additional testing tools, and hiring external experts to address issues of accuracy or bias. These costs are estimated to be between \\$15,000 and \\$25,000. In addition, a large amount of indirect costs related to user trust cannot be ignored. When artificial intelligence malfunctions, it reduces credibility, leading to higher customer support costs, increased marketing expenditures for rebuilding reputation, and if user trust cannot be restored, it may even result in user churn. This risk is expected to cause a financial loss of \\$25,000 to \\$40,000, and it will also cause issues of project delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **R09 - Conflicts among team members:**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Time impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this is not a technical risk, conflicts within the project team still have the potential to cause significant disruptions. Poor communication, disagreement in opinions, or insufficient team cohesion can all lead to project delays, resulting in productivity losses equivalent to one sprint cycle. In more severe cases, if the conflict leads to employee resignation, the onboarding of new employees may extend the project cycle by four to six weeks, thereby having a cascading impact on multiple interrelated tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Cost impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The costs for mediation, conflict resolution seminars, and team-building activities are estimated to be between \\$10,000 and \\$15,000. Additionally, the indirect impact could be even greater, as replacing an experienced engineer or project leader due to staff turnover might require a payment of 20% to 30% of their annual salary. The ongoing tension can also lower morale, reduce enthusiasm, and damage productivity, thereby affecting the quality of project outcomes. Overall, this risk could lead to financial losses ranging from \\$15,000 to \\$50,000 and project delays of two to eight weeks, with the specific duration depending on the severity.\n",

      "\n",
      "<span id=\"page-28-0\"></span>Throughout this project our team worked well together in accordance with the goals and commitments outlined in our working agreement. We found our main team objective of academic success, driving us to work hard both individually and collectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recurring issue we faced was our clashing schedules, we were often only able to meet as a full team once a week. This wasn't detrimental to our project as we employed strong communication to stay on top of due dates and work loads. When a specific team member was unable to work with the rest of the group, they took accountability by completing their share of the work another time. In one case, this led to us being less prepared than we would have liked to be for our presentation, however we learnt from this and organised ourselves more effectively for the later parts of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "An area where we excelled was work allocation, we wanted allocation to be flexible and comfortable but also fair. This approach allowed for team members to show their strength in their work. An example of this is during the WBS and gantt chart section of the assignment, Chengwei and Jack had a much easier time working together completing the wordier aspects of the slides, while Nidhin and Joseph found great success collaborating on the WBS and gantt chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were times during the project when team members had differing opinions on how to complete a specific task. We had no issues resolving said issues and found that these conversations actually led to an improved quality in our work. An example of this was during the cost breakdown, a group member seemed unsure if we were formatting our work correctly, this led to an open conversation, giving us a deeper understanding of the task. We all feel we displayed openness and appreciation for feedback, always taking time to listen to what someone else was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The structure of our group was flexible, this allowed for different team members to take initiative when they felt comfortable. This approach allowed for everyone to guide different parts of the project, while also not taking on too large a workload.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately our collaborative success was guided by core values as part of the team agreement. While we could have managed our time more efficiently, our strong communication and team structure allowed us to achieve our goals. For us this project reiterated the importance of open communication, flexibility and teamwork skills which we will apply in the future projects.\n",

      "We had 5 weeks to work on this group project for LifeLoop to plan, design and develop an IT-driven project. Initially we had different opinions on selecting a project idea suitable for our team. This left me feeling a bit confused and anxious, as selecting the best suitable project idea is important since it would shape all our deliverables over the course of this project. Then we decided to list down the positives and negatives of each given project idea and pick the most appropriate one, enabling us to brainstorm many ideas for our project effectively and present a work of high quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, this project gave me a practical opportunity to apply my project management skills and understandings that I have gained from this unit such as risk management, cost estimation, WBS etc…. During this assignment, I actively took responsibility for coordinating the group, setting up Zoom meetings and ensuring everyone completes the assigned tasks before the planned deadline. We had lost a considerable amount of time while working this project due to misaligned assumptions which caused inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the deliverables. Personally, this experience taught me that active participation early in the process avoids rework and delays later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, I will continue to take responsibility for organising meetings but also try to encourage early active participation and clearer task distribution. I would give myself an HD as I believe I have strongly contributed in many parts of the project. For my team I would give an HD as well, as we demonstrated strong collaboration and understanding of the project requirements.\n",

      "#### **Chengwei Zu 35002875**\n",
      "\n",
      "For our group assignment, we had chosen LoopCare Digital Health Companion as the subject for our project. While working in a group, my task was to ensure the project schedule and task allocation were clear and reasonable enough to help the team break down complex tasks into simpler tasks. While progressing on my tasks, I had many consultations with my peers, not only perfecting my skill in project management tools but also enriching my own insight into the entire procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the course of the project, the initial difficult problem encountered was inconsistent schedules of teammates. We could not easily assemble on a regular basis for a series of group meetings, and therefore we lacked proper preparations in the early stages for some of the tasks,such as appropriate setting up of presentation materials. It made me learn the importance of early preparation and coordination of communication, though. We then made up for such a shortcoming by precisely defining tasks and flexibly adapting schedules later on, and it also taught me to maintain the smooth functioning of the team in situations of limited resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this assignment, I learned that in a cooperative working environment, not only do we need to fulfill our own responsibilities, but we also need to actively help one another and remain open-minded in taking in and providing input. I myself was actively involved in this\n",

      "\n",
      "During the completion of the assignment in which we were to plan a project, in our case, LoopCare, we frequently had open discussions to figure out the best way of proceeding with the project. We used various techniques during these open discussions ensuring we were open to all perspectives and used ways of forming the best conclusion. I felt that I contributed to an extent to these discussions, however, upon reflection I felt that I could have thought about the various topics in more depth so that I could contribute in a more meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Nidhin and I worked on the WBS and the gantt chart. I was the one using the software to create the gantt chart, as I had previous experience with creating these charts, whilst Nidhin helped structure all the tasks and their durations. I felt that I should have thought more critically about the implications of our timeline especially in terms of the critical path as that is something I didn't think carefully enough about. Furthermore, when completing other parts of the assignment, I felt I should have contributed more and taken a more proactive approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "For future assignments, I need to be more proactive in completing my fair share of the assignment while also communicating more effectively to better understand the complexity of the assignment inline with the rest of the group. I would give myself a C, as I wasn't proactive enough and didn't complete my parts of the assignment in a timely manner. I would give the group an HD, as communication was strong despite schedules getting in the way of meeting as a group.\n",

      "Our group chose LoopCare for our project, over the course of the assignment I learnt a lot about not only project management but also collaboration and communication. From the beginning we wanted everyone to share their thoughts and work collaboratively, I feel we carried this approach through our project well. Whether we were deciding on the specific direction our app would take or how we divided the work and managed issues we always included everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I regret I wasn't able to attend class as much or for as long as I would have liked, my team were understanding of my situation which I really appreciated. Despite this I feel I contributed my share of the work towards our project, and made sure to never compromise on quality. I enjoyed learning practical aspects of project management, however I now recognise the importance of the more team oriented and organisational skills. Work allocation, scheduling, and simply working as a team, over this project I have honed these less practical skills and feel much more competent to face similar projects in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something I'm proud of about how we completed this project was our flexibility, whether in finding time to meet or how we completed our work, it made it a lot easier for me to feel a part of the team and contribute accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite challenges along the way I'm very happy with how we performed as a team and the work we produced. In the future I aim to be more organised, manage my time and schedule. I feel a D represents my work however as a team an HD better represents our project.\n",
