| Team<br>characteristics | Strengths<br>Our team is well-organised and focused. Some members are good at planning<br>and building a structure for the project. One member acts like a "lubricant" in<br>the team-friendly, calm environment, and helps everyone work together<br>smoothly. We care about time and always try to meet deadlines.<br>We also have strong research skills and are good at collecting, analysing and<br>processing information, and we adjust our project direction when needed.<br>Weaknesses<br>Some members may have a tendency to procrastinate. We will aim to be<br>transparent with our progress, asking for help where needed to avoid this<br>weakness. Additionally, individual deadlines will be established to assist.<br>Some of our members have difficulty in standing in front of an audience whilst<br>presenting. To combat this, we will allocate our confident members more<br>responsibility during presentations, whilst the nervous members are allocated<br>more tasks surrounding visuals and speech writing.<br>Our team as a whole |

|                                                | Ultimately, we have a well-rounded team, with all members showcasing<br>differing strengths and qualities. This allows us to be role-dependent, where<br>individuals can be motivated by working on specific tasks that they enjoy and<br>are good at. This provides us with the best chance at producing the highest<br>quality of work possible. |  |  |  |  |

|                                                | Transparency<br>Open communication means that we are honest in our progress. If we have any<br>issues or concerns with achieving objectives, we should voice them, as it assists<br>in overall team connectedness and ultimately success in achieving goals.                                                                                       |  |  |  |  |
|                                                | Meeting the deadlines<br>Each member will be allocated roles, and specific work with goals. Dates will<br>be assigned for individual due dates, creating clear expectations for deadlines.                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |  |
| Core<br>values                                 | High Quality Output<br>We are aiming to achieve the highest score for the project as possible, and by<br>holding ourselves accountable to create a high quality of work, this assists us in<br>achieving the goal.                                                                                                                                 |  |  |  |  |
|                                                | Equality<br>All members strive to maintain equality by completing their allocated tasks to<br>the best of their abilities. If a member is unable to produce a satisfactory amount<br>or quality of work, they will strive to assist in other ways.                                                                                                 |  |  |  |  |
|                                                | Each group member is expected to complete equal amount/difficulty of work.<br>Consistent communication is also vital, meaning group members should take no<br>longer than 24 hours to respond, aiming to be active in group chats and<br>attending in-person meetings.                                                                             |  |  |  |  |
| Group<br>norms<br>and<br>code<br>of<br>conduct | We will work together by having assigned roles, where members are allocated<br>due to their strengths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |  |  |  |
|                                                | Despite having individual roles, we will work as a team, meaning that our<br>contributions should align together and with a common goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |  |  |  |
|                                                | Failure to adhere to our group code of conduct and norms should be voiced to<br>the group so that everyone is made aware, and we can work together to<br>overcome any challenges.                                                                                                                                                                  |  |  |  |  |

| Participation<br>and<br>collaboration<br>approach | We prefer using a shared platform like Google Drive for the work we have<br>done. This means having one document for planning and brainstorming, then<br>using a final document for submission.<br>We will have a zoom meeting 1-2 times per week in order to rectify problems<br>and create plans for future tasks. We have established that Wednesdays is our<br>best day for in person meetings, which works well as it is the day before our<br>applied class. We will use class time efficiently, and ensure that we have one<br>other time to discuss progress throughout the week.<br>We will aim to complete all work at least 1-2 days before deadlines, so that we<br>can review our progress, and make necessary adjustments formulated in a final<br>meeting. This allows us to come together and be aligned in achieving the<br>common goal of each task.<br>Feedback can also be given to each other in a respectful manner during<br>meetings. We prefer transparency, so the team can progress accordingly, and<br>formulate the highest standard of work.<br>We would like everyone to be active during the meeting and fulfill their part as<br>a team so that everyone can have an evenly distributed workload and help the<br>others who are struggling in the team.<br>In meetings, we will not only review our quality of work, but also how we |

#### **Project Title: Loopcare: Digital Wellness Companion**

Loopcare is a wellness-focused mobile application that aims to improve the user's lifestyle and behaviour through habit tracking and community engagement. Loopcare achieves this by providing gentle reminders, such as a simple notification pop-up at a specific time. The overall purpose of Loopcare is to give users an accessible and user-friendly platform that allows individuals to monitor emotional well-being, sleep, hydration, and screen time, while also encouraging mindfulness and social connection. Loopcare aims to achieve a positive change for the users.

The boundaries of LoopCare include a strong background in UX/UI design and usability testing, with the app being released on IOS and Android, as well as some usability testing. The major deliverables include a wellness tracking module, mindfulness exercises, community challenges, and gamification features, all of which collectively define the scope of the product.

### <span id="page-14-0"></span>Out of scope and conclusions

Loopcare will exclude advanced third-party integrations beyond core LifeLoop tools, such as wearable devices. Custom enterprise versions, desktop-only editions, and non-English localisations are also excluded from scope. Features such as AI-driven predictive analytics for long-term behavioural change and complex gamification systems are not part of the current release. Extensive customer support operations are also out of scope to prevent scope creep.

### <span id="page-14-1"></span>Constraints and Assumptions

Key constraints include a fixed budget of \$300,000 and an 18-month development timeline. The project is limited to iOS and Android mobile platforms, with technology restricted to in-house development and standard APIs. Assumptions include consistent stakeholder engagement for feedback, user willingness to share routine and habit data, and reliable access to cloud services for syncing. These assumptions will be validated through pilot testing, periodic reviews, and controlled usability trials.

## <span id="page-33-0"></span>**Task 4.1 Group Reflection**

Using Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (1988), a reflection on personal emotions, evaluation of the team, and takeaways for growth can be achieved:

#### **1. Description**

Our team was able to partly achieve desired objectives set out in the Working Agreement. Daniel acted as a leader, by appointing tasks and deadlines to keep the team's progress on track. Colin with his skills in software and visual presentation tended to create powerpoints and planning our 2 minute pitch, and project plan demonstration. Edward and Darren used their expertise and theory skills to produce high quality analysis throughout the report.

#### **2. Feelings**

Initially, our group was confident in achieving success, as we assigned roles that assisted us in communication and planning for deadlines. We effectively designated tasks based on individual strengths and weaknesses, in hopes of producing a high quality of output. However, at times there was concern, with individuals failing to contribute adequately within the specified time frame. This concern was voiced in our group chat and meetings using honest communication, to formulate a solution to the issue. This supportive attitude from all members contributed to our investment in success.

#### **3. Evaluation**

One specific strength that was evident in the project's lifecycle was adaptability. All members were able to ultimately contribute equally, regardless of designated tasks and deadlines. Despite challenges regarding unequal contributions that had potential to create conflict, all members adhered to our code of conduct to maturely address the situation. This ability to be adaptable and problem solve highlighted the team's emotional intelligence and commitment to success.

#### **4. Analysis**

The effective use of the Working Agreement throughout the project assisted us in managing workloads and conflict resolution. The assigned communication tools (group chat, and in person meetings) provided us with transparency. With defined roles and responsibilities, it was easy to hold accountability, however, we failed to appropriately monitor progress consistently, leading to the mentioned challenges.

#### **5. Conclusion**

While we were able to adhere to the Working Agreement, and achieve part of the objectives and completion of the project, our group could have made use of the task tracking tool to monitor progress on a regular basis. The experience highlighted the importance of planning and monitoring, and how communication and a commitment to honesty can overcome challenges in group work.

#### **6. Action Plan**

In the future, group members will know to utilise frequent reviews of progress to ensure alignment with the plan. Therefore, feedback will be ongoing as opposed to reactive. Additionally, it will be critical to maintain efficient communication during problem-solving to resolve conflicts and overcome challenges.

### <span id="page-34-1"></span>Daniel McGuirk's (31494854) Individual Reflection:

My experience throughout the lifecycle of this project was filled with mixed emotions. In the early stages, it appeared that the group's motivation was present, and we had confidence in success due to our ability to plan and distribute tasks. With deadlines approaching, we were behind schedule in terms of progress, so I attempted to take on more of a leadership role to get everyone organised.

Despite feeling at times that I was carrying an unfair workload, and was left to do all of the tasks that were not officially assigned, the group's ability to be adaptable was exceptional. I can commend them for their unselfishness in the face of adversity, as we all understood that life can interrupt progress in a group assignment of this nature. This meant team members taking on tasks they were not assigned, and other team members doing an exceptional job in redeeming themselves for failing to complete their tasks.

Ultimately, I can say that I am proud of the way I contributed to the project. I have learnt that I am a capable leader, who can enforce accountability whilst simultaneously forgiving. The role brought me stress, and I know moving forward that this is not the position I would volunteer for. Furthermore, I now understand and am grateful for my team members who were respectful and unselfish throughout the process. Their flexibility throughout our operation is a critical quality, which will be essential for all group work going forward.

In this project, I joined every team meeting and was active in discussions. I helped check the assignment requirements carefully and made sure we followed the rules. I also helped create and check our PowerPoint slides. When we were behind, I organised Zoom meetings and reminded my team to meet and talk. I think I helped with team communication and kept things on track. But I know I can do more. Next time, I want to take more tasks like writing the report or helping with time planning. I also want to give support to others more clearly.

Our team had some problems in making plans. At the beginning, we didn't have clear task roles. Everyone just chose what they wanted to do. This made the work a bit confusing. But our team was still flexible. When Edward had personal problems, we shared the work and finished on time. I really liked how my teammates were kind and supported each other. This made me feel safe and encouraged me to work harder. I learned that teamwork needs clear task planning, better tools like task trackers, and more communication. Next time, I will be more active and do more to help my group.

### <span id="page-35-0"></span>Darren Christoff (34253041) Individual Reflection:

We had a period of five weeks to develop and deliver a research group presentation on a topic of our choice related to creating an app for a company. We had separated the tasks for individuals/duos to work on to share the tasks fairly and to finish them on time. I was pretty proud of the quick decision and allocation of tasks, as we had wasted almost no time arguing over who was responsible for what task. Everything had been progressing well with all members of the group doing their tasks. However, some circumstances arose, and one of our group members was unable to complete/assist with a task, and the other member had to complete the task by themselves. This led to an avalanche effect, causing all the group members to have to handle more workload. In the end, we gave that group member extra workload to make it fair and as a chance for redemption.

Ultimately, this was a positive experience as it taught me, even if preparations are completed and perfect, some unforeseen circumstances could occur and derail the whole process, making it important to have some sort of backup plan just in case. Moving forward, I think that we should use the task tracker to assign the tasks more clearly to make it fair for everyone in the group and to make it as efficient as possible.

### <span id="page-35-1"></span>Edward (34034765) Individual Reflection:

While doing this assignment, I had a lot of things going on like work, sickness, and other personal matters going on at the same time. These made it hard for me to keep up with the task given to me, contribute to the team, and even miss the presentation day. I felt really guilty because it slowed down the team, and I also didn't want to bring the whole team down.

Despite the struggle, my team worked really well overall. We divided tasks fairly at the beginning, and when problems came up, everyone was adaptable and willing to take on extra responsibilities, such as the problem I faced. I really appreciated how supportive the group was, which motivated me to do more at the end by focusing on the report and taking up more part of the report after sorting out my personal problems to make up for what I didn't do.

From this assignment, I learned that I need to manage my time and stress better, transparent about my situation, not thinking that I can handle it all. At the same time, this process also made me realise how important teamwork, communication, and adaptability are when working in a group. In the future, I

would like to contribute more consistently to the group so that I can match the effort my teammate puts in and not feel guilty for my team.
