# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Project Charter – LoopTasks**

**Project Title:** LoopTasks – Smart Daily Routine Organiser **Project Manager:** Fares Elkordy - contacted via felk0002@student.monash.edu

### **Description**

LoopTasks is a cross-platform assistant that streamlines daily routines for families and individuals. Some features of the app are shared family calendars, habit tracking, an AI-powered scheduling engine that adapts to user behavior, and voice-enabled task capture. The project aims to reduce missed tasks, improve coordination, and foster healthier habits by providing simple and accessible digital tools.

### **Project Scope And Objectives**

### **In Scope:**

- Develop a mobile application for both IOS and Android with a shared calendar, voice capture, and habit tracking using AI.
- Develop a web dashboard for lightweight access and data export.
- Design a scheduler that's AI-driven, to adapt to the user habits so it can recommend the best routines.
- Cross-device synchronisation and integrations with Google, Apple, and Microsoft calendars.
- Offer customizable reminders and alerts tailored to user preferences.

### **Out of Scope:**

- Any monetisation or payment-related functionality.
- Advanced enterprise-level controls
- Multi-language capabilities beyond English in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release.
- Incorporation of external third-party advertising

### **SMART Objectives:**

- Deliver an MVP app within 9 months to validate LifeLoop's investment..
- Achieve 70% task completion rate to demonstrate measurable behavioural impact, aligned with LifeLoop's goal of improving daily coordination..
- Ensure all core user flows comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards before launch.
- Deliver within the allocated budget cap of \$300,000 while meeting milestones.

### **Project Start and Finish Dates**

- Planned Start: 01 September 2025
- Planned Finish: 01 March 2027 (18 months development + testing)
- Maintenance Window: Up to 18 months post-launch (outside core scope, subject to agreement).

### **High-Level Budget Estimate**

- Total Estimated Cost: \$300,000 (capped, not flexible).
- Includes labor, software licenses, infrastructure, overheads, and a 15–20% contingency.

### **Project Development Approach**

A hybrid approach will be used:

- Predictive (Waterfall) for planning, governance, and scope definition.
- Adaptive (Agile) sprints (2–3 weeks) for design, development, and testing.

This balance provides predictability for cost and timeline control while ensuring flexibility for iterative usability improvements, consistent with PMBOK.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**LoopTasks – 2-Minute Pitch**

### Hook (10s)

"Ever forgotten your child's soccer game or missed a bill because the day was too hectic? We all know the stress of juggling work, family, and routines — and too often, things slip through the cracks."

### Problem (20s)

"Families juggle multiple schedules and habits daily. Current apps are rigid, designed for tasks on paper, not real life. The result? Missed commitments and unnecessary stress."

### Solution (30s)

"LoopTasks is a smart daily organiser powered by AI and voice. It captures tasks in seconds, automatically adapts schedules, and provides families with a shared calendar and habit tracker. It learns how you live, so the app works for you — not the other way around."

### Strategic Fit (20s)

"This project aligns with LifeLoop's mission: simple, inclusive, personalised tools. By leveraging LifeLoop's strengths in usability and full-stack development, LoopTasks delivers real value to families."

### Features / Deliverables (20s)

"LoopTasks will launch with four core deliverables: voice reminders, shared family calendar, habit tracking, and adaptive AI scheduling. Plus seamless cross-device sync. All achievable within 18 months and a \$300k budget."

### Why Us (20s)

"LoopTasks saves time, reduces stress, and keeps families in sync. Backed by a realistic plan, milestones, and accessibility standards, our project is ambitious yet achievable — the strongest fit for LifeLoop."

Closing Call-to-Action (10s) "Don't lose track, don't fall back — choose LoopTasks to keep your day on track."

### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**Gantt Chart Justification**

The project schedule was developed using a bottom-up approach, aligning durations directly with WBS tasks and industry benchmarks for software development (Project Management Institute, 2021). Initiation and Planning phases were allocated shorter durations (15 and 40 days) to reflect their document-driven nature, while Execution was allocated the majority of time (310 days) to account for labour-intensive design, development, integration, and testing. Dependencies were structured logically: foundational modules such as the Shared Family Calendar and Synchronisation precede advanced features like AI Scheduling and the Habit Tracker, while parallel development of independent components (e.g., Voice Capture and Calendar UI) shortens the timeline. Buffer periods and testing activities were embedded to manage risks of rework, particularly around integration points. This phasing ensures all deliverables fit within the 18-month cap defined in the Charter, while maintaining feasibility, critical path visibility, and alignment with industry-standard SDLC practices.

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Cost Estimation Methodology & Justification**

### **Methodology Used**

The cost model was developed using a bottom-up estimation method, starting at the activity and work package level from the approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and rolling costs upward to deliverable categories (Hays, 2023). This is consistent with Workshop 5 guidance that bottom-up provides the most accurate estimate for complex IT projects. Where appropriate, analogous estimation was also applied (e.g., cloud hosting and tool subscriptions) using vendor pricing benchmarks (Hays, 2024).

### **Labour Costs**

Labour represents the largest cost driver (74% of total). Hours were derived directly from WBS task durations and dependencies. Rates were aligned with the Hays Salary Guide FY25/26, selecting conservative figures at the lower bound of each role's range. For example,Project Managers (\$70/hr) and Tech Leads (\$75/hr) were benchmarked against Hays' IT project contract rates of \$65–\$100/hr. Developers, UX/UI designers, and testers were priced at \$50–\$60/hr, consistent with entry-to-mid-level ranges (Hays, 2024). The ML/DS Specialist rate (\$65/hr) is slightly below Hays' mid-level benchmark (\$70–\$110/hr), but was intentionally set lower to reflect the use of a blended junior/mid resource. This conservative approach ensures estimates remain realistic while maintaining alignment with the \$300,000 Charter cap and supporting cost control discipline (Hays, 2024).

### **Materials, Software, and Services**

Material and software costs include essential tools (Figma, CI/CD services, analytics, and developer accounts) and modest hardware for testing. Vendor services include lightweight penetration testing, accessibility audits, and cloud monitoring. These were priced analogously against published subscription and consultancy rates (Hays, 2024).

### **Training and Operational Costs**

Pilot family training, onboarding, and operational runbooks were included to ensure adoption and support. These are modest in scale given the MVP scope but demonstrate recognition of transition and change management activities (Hays, 2024).

### **Overheads**

Overheads (5% of labour) account for project governance, administration, and indirect costs such as facilities, licenses, and compliance support. This is consistent with PMBOK guidance on including indirect costs in the cost baseline (Hays, 2024).

### **Contingency**

A contingency of 15% was applied to labour, materials, and services (totalling \$38,014). This is justified by identified risks in the Risk Register (Workshop 6), particularly:

- Reliance on third-party calendar APIs (risk of cost/effort increase).
- Potential performance tuning to achieve the P95 <200ms requirement.
- Risk of scope creep and change requests.

The 15% level is within industry practice (15–20%) and balances risk coverage without breaching the Charter budget cap.

### **Cost Baseline Alignment**

The total cost of \$299,438 is fully aligned to the Charter cap (\$300k). Costs will be time-phased into a cost baseline consistent with the project schedule: low during Initiation and Planning, peaking during Execution (labour-intensive development and integration), and tapering in Closure (final testing, training, and handover) (Hays, 2024).

Cost monitoring will be managed using Earned Value Management (EVM) at phase gates. Variance thresholds of ±10% will trigger corrective actions, ensuring the \$300,000 cap is strictly maintained (Hays, 2024).

### Assumptions and Dependencies

This cost model assumes stable third-party API pricing, 7.5-hour productive working days, and no significant scope creep beyond defined deliverables. Vendor services (security and accessibility reviews) are benchmarked against industry consultancy averages. Contingency is distributed primarily across Execution and Closure phases to mitigate identified risks such as API policy changes and performance optimisation.

The cost baseline is time-phased to match the project lifecycle. Initiation and Planning require relatively low investment (15% of total) as these phases are document-driven. Execution absorbs the majority of costs (70%), reflecting the labour-intensive development of mobile, web, and AI components. Closure requires a smaller allocation (5%) for final testing, training, and handover. Contingency (10%) is spread across Execution and Closure to cover risks identified in the register, such as calendar API changes and performance optimisation. The baseline totals \$299,438, consistent with the \$300,000 Charter cap, and will be tracked via Earned Value Management (EVM) and phase-gate reviews to monitor variance against plan.

## **Risk Register Requirements**

Risks were identified through team brainstorming sessions, scenario planning, and review of industry standards (Workshop 6). Each member proposed risks aligned with their expertise, which were analysed using a probability–impact scale (1–5). The risks were prioritised via a probability–impact matrix, with team consensus on likelihood and impact scoring. Response strategies were then developed, balancing feasibility with budget constraints.

### **Risk Matrix**

<span id="page-21-0"></span>![](_page_21_Figure_1.jpeg)

### **Justifications for Risks (R01–R13)**

<span id="page-22-0"></span>R01: Calendar API policy change (Google/Apple/Microsoft)

- **Why risk?** External dependencies (third-party APIs) are common risk sources because vendors can change terms, pricing, or deprecate features unexpectedly.
- **Probability = 4:** These API providers regularly change access terms (e.g., Google Calendar API quota limits updated 2022). Not "almost certain," but **likely**.
- **Impact = 5:** Without functioning calendar sync, LoopTasks loses its core value proposition (shared family scheduling). This is catastrophic for MVP.
- **Reference:** PMBOK (2021) highlights vendor dependency as a high-risk category in IT projects; Workshop 6 flagged "supplier dependency" as external risk. (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R02: OS updates break app compatibility (iOS/Android)

- **Why risk?** Mobile OS vendors (Apple, Google) push major updates yearly. Apps often face regressions (Apple iOS 16 broke many apps with background task rules).
- **Probability = 3:** OS updates are certain, but **breakages vary**. Medium likelihood.
- **Impact = 5:** If LoopTasks crashes or fails post-update, trust and adoption collapse → catastrophic.
- **Reference:** (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R03: Voice recognition fails in noisy/accented environments

- **Why risk?** Voice UX has high error rates in real-world conditions (background noise, diverse accents). Microsoft reports error rates of 15–20% in uncontrolled contexts.
- **Probability = 4:** Likely because user diversity = inconsistent accuracy.
- **Impact = 4:** Feature remains usable with fallback, but adoption targets (70% completion) at risk. Not catastrophic, but major.
- **Reference:** Workshop 6 notes "functional failure under environment" as a product risk.

R04: Poor AI scheduling suggestions

- **Why risk?** AI-based recommendations may not align with user needs if models lack enough data or contextual rules.
- **Probability = 3:** AI "cold start" problem is common (low data early stage). Possible but not inevitable.
- **Impact = 4:** Bad suggestions = user frustration → weak adoption of flagship feature.
- **Reference:** Gartner highlights AI adoption risks tied to "explainability and user trust." (Groombridge, 2022)

R05: Accessibility features not implemented early

- **Why risk?** Retro-fitting accessibility (WCAG compliance) is more costly than building early. Industry reports show **30–50% cost increases** if done late.
- **Probability = 2:** Possible if ignored, but the team already flagged accessibility in scope.
- **Impact = 5:** Non-compliance blocks users with disabilities, reputational/legal impact → catastrophic.
- **Reference:** WCAG 2.1 standards; Workshop 6 "regulatory compliance risk."

R06: Data breach or insecure integration

- **Why risk?** Handling family data (tasks, schedules) makes security crucial. Breaches → reputational loss and legal risk.
- **Probability = 2:** Lower, since encryption + DPIA planned.
- **Impact = 5:** A breach is catastrophic in trust + legal terms.
- **Reference:** ISO/IEC 27005 (InfoSec risk standard); PMBOK lists data security as "high impact." (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R07: Pilot families disengage

- **Why risk?** Without pilot user feedback, iterative improvements fail. Adoption rate goals can't be validated.
- **Probability = 3:** Engagement risk is possible; many pilots show low participation without incentives.
- **Impact = 3:** Delays learning loops → medium impact.
- **Reference:** Agile practice guides (PMI) emphasise stakeholder feedback as a critical success factor. (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R08: Stakeholder conflict/slow approvals

- **Why risk?** Conflicting priorities between sponsor, product lead, accessibility lead can cause decision bottlenecks.
- **Probability = 2:** Not highly likely but possible given multiple roles.
- **Impact = 4:** Approval delays can block schedule-critical tasks.
- **Reference:** PMBOK's stakeholder engagement risk; Workshop 6 "internal political risk." (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R09: Key developer leaves mid-project

- **Why risk?** IT projects face turnover risk; industry turnover rate for developers = 13.2% annually (LinkedIn 2023).
- **Probability = 2:** Possible, not highly likely in 18 months.
- **Impact = 4:** Loss of velocity, knowledge gaps, possible rework.
- **Reference:** PMBOK identifies human resource risk as high relevance in Agile projects. (Project Management Institute, 2021)

R10: Internal team conflict/poor communication

- **Why risk?** Misalignment in distributed Agile teams leads to delays and morale loss.
- **Probability = 2:** Team charter already exists, so lower probability.
- **Impact = 3:** Medium: delays and reduced productivity, but not catastrophic.
- **Reference:** Workshop 6 flagged "internal conflicts" as people risk.

R11: Underestimation of cross-platform dev effort

- **Why risk?** Building sync across iOS, Android, and Web often underestimated; integration costs hidden.
- **Probability = 3:** Common in student and industry projects.
- **Impact = 4:** Can push timeline and cost baseline significantly.
- **Reference:** McConnell (2006) *Software Estimation*: underestimation = most frequent cause of project overruns. (McConnell, 2006)

R12: Regulatory changes (privacy, children's data)

- **Why risk?** Apps handling personal/family data must comply with GDPR, COPPA, OAIC. Sudden changes = rework.
- **Probability = 1:** Rare frameworks stable, but not impossible.
- **Impact = 5:** Non-compliance = legal liability, reputational damage → catastrophic.
- **Reference:** Workshop 6 "regulatory environment risks."

R13: Strong user adoption in pilots

- **Why risk?** This is an opportunity risk: if pilot families adopt the app strongly, it can accelerate stakeholder confidence, validate MVP feasibility earlier, and create opportunities for an early release or added support. By treating it as a managed risk, the team can plan to leverage the benefit rather than leaving it to chance.
- **Probability = 3**: Medium likelihood. While strong adoption is possible, pilot engagement often varies, and not all families may show high uptake without targeted support.
- **Impact = 4**: High. Strong adoption would provide compelling evidence for stakeholders, improve project credibility, and potentially reduce time-to-market by securing early validation.
- **Reference:** PMBOK (2021) emphasises that project risk management covers both threats and opportunities. Opportunity risks can be managed using an "exploit" strategy to maximise benefits (Project Management Institute, 2021).

## <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Cost/Time Implications**

Cost and time implications of response strategies were considered. For example, API abstraction and fallback sync (R01) adds a 10-day buffer and \$5k cost; continuous beta testing and device labs for OS updates (R02) require \$3k and 15 extra days; security penetration testing (R06) incurs a \$3k vendor cost; and onboarding a replacement developer (R09) could require 2 weeks. These reserves are integrated into the 15% contingency in the cost baseline, ensuring realistic coverage. (Patterson & Neailey, 2002)

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**Group Reflection**

Working together on our project plans gave us the chance to put our Team Charter into practice and see how well our group values worked in reality. Looking back, we feel our collaboration was shaped by the way we handled leadership, support, feedback, and conflict resolution.

In terms of leadership, Fares displayed outstanding leadership as he provided us with a clear goal and tasks to accomplish for the project. Other members also voiced their opinions to help with the project. For example, some of us took the lead in drafting the scope, while others kept track of deadlines and reminded the team of upcoming meetings. This approach worked well because it meant no one felt overwhelmed, and everyone had a chance to contribute their strengths.

Providing support to one another was a significant factor in our success. We knew from the beginning that our busy schedules could cause challenges, so we made an effort to check in and share the workload when someone was falling behind. Tools like Google Docs allowed us to step in easily if someone needed help, and our weekly meetings gave us space to update each other on progress. Having that safety net meant we felt comfortable asking for help, rather than struggling in silence.

Feedback sharing has become one of the most valuable aspects of our teamwork. We made sure to give feedback that was constructive and specific, rather than just pointing out problems. For example, when reviewing each other's sections, we would suggest concrete improvements rather than vague criticism. This made feedback feel like part of the process instead of something negative, and it helped us produce stronger outputs overall.

Of course, we also had moments of disagreement, which tested our conflict resolution methods. Sometimes we had different ideas about how to prioritise tasks or what features to emphasise. In these situations, we reminded ourselves of the agreement we made to hear everyone out. After everyone shared their perspective, we often used our voting method to make a fair decision. When a vote wasn't enough, we tried to find a middle ground. These discussions were always respectful, which kept conflicts from turning personal.

Overall, we feel our collaboration reflected the strengths we outlined in our charter: open communication, respect, and teamwork. While we did struggle at times with procrastination and time management, our support systems and shared leadership helped us overcome these challenges. From this experience, we learned that clearer time-boxing and earlier draft deadlines would make our work even stronger in future projects. Using a reflective approach similar to Gibbs' Cycle, we considered what happened, the impact of our actions, and what we would improve, ensuring that our teamwork experience translates into lessons for future projects.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>Individual Reflection Ralph Thang's Reflection

<span id="page-26-1"></span>In this project, I contributed by completing the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), collaborating with my group on task allocations, and preparing the presentation slides. Working on the RTM helped me strengthen my attention to detail, as I had to ensure that each requirement was accurately linked to its corresponding deliverables. This also gave me a clearer understanding of how requirements flow through a project and how they influence outcomes.

Through this process, I also improved my ability to break down complex tasks into manageable parts when working on the WBS and presentation. Collaboration within the team played an important role in keeping me accountable and ensuring consistency across our outputs. Regular discussions helped us avoid duplication and gave us the opportunity to build on each other's ideas, which made the final product stronger.

At times, I found it challenging to manage my time alongside other unit assignments, but teamwork motivated me to stay on track and meet deadlines. I believe my contribution was valuable in terms of ensuring accuracy in documentation and clarity in the presentation. If I were to improve, I would prepare earlier and take a more active role in leading group discussions.

Overall, I would grade my personal performance as a High Distinction, as I consistently delivered quality work and collaborated effectively. I would also grade my team's performance as a High Distinction, as we supported each other and produced a professional outcome that reflected genuine teamwork.

### <span id="page-26-2"></span>Jireh Loh's Reflection

During this project, I was responsible for explaining the Gantt chart, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and the first two milestones in our group presentation. Initially, I found it challenging to interpret the critical path, as not every deliverable I expected to be critical was highlighted in ProjectLibre. For example, the Habit Tracker and Mobile App were blue (non-critical), while Cross-device Synchronisation and Web Dashboard were red. This taught me the importance of relying on project management tools and data rather than assumptions.

Through this experience, I developed stronger analytical skills by manually verifying the critical path calculations and matching them to the total project duration. Working on the WBS also improved my ability to break down complex tasks into manageable deliverables, which enhanced my understanding of project scheduling and dependencies.

At times, I struggled with time management, especially balancing this project with other unit assignments. However, collaborating with my team encouraged accountability, as each member relied on the others to deliver their sections. Regular communication ensured we aligned our outputs and avoided duplication.

I believe my contribution to the team was valuable, especially in clarifying technical aspects of scheduling. If I were to improve, I would prepare earlier and contribute more actively in guiding group discussions.

Overall, I would grade my personal performance as a High Distinction level. I would grade my team's performance as a High Distinction, as we worked cohesively, supported each other, and produced a professional outcome that reflected genuine teamwork.

### <span id="page-27-0"></span>Joshua Sentana's Reflection

My main role in the project involved shaping the project scope, compiling references, and preparing milestone justifications for the presentation. Each of these tasks required both a solid understanding of project management concepts and the ability to communicate ideas clearly. While I initially thought scope writing would be straightforward, I soon realised the challenge of being clear yet detailed. The referencing process was time-consuming but manageable, and I felt confident in my research and citation skills. The milestone justification, however, proved to be the most demanding, as it required not only explaining milestones but also demonstrating their significance.

Overall, I performed well in producing clear, structured content, particularly in the scope and references sections, which enhanced the professionalism of our report. I recognise, however, that my milestone justification could have been a bit more detailed. This does prompt me to explain more through words instead of just reading the slides, but a few more sentences to explain could do better. Through the process, I learned the importance of adjusting how information is presented depending on the audience, balancing accuracy, clarity, and persuasiveness.

This experience helped me strengthen my skills in project documentation, referencing, and justifying project decisions. Team feedback was particularly valuable in refining my work, and I learned to accept constructive criticism as a way to improve. Going forward, I plan to focus more on brevity in presentations and continue practicing how to adapt content for different contexts. Based on my contributions and growth, I would grade myself at least a Distinction. For the team, I would give a High Distinction, as we worked effectively together, supported each other, and delivered the goal we were striving towards.

### <span id="page-27-1"></span>Fares Elkordy's Reflection

In this project, I took on the role of Project Manager and was primarily responsible for developing the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), coordinating the Gantt chart, and ensuring our deliverables aligned with the project charter and scope. Preparing these gave me a stronger understanding of dependencies, critical paths, and how they link directly to cost estimation and risk management.

I focused on guiding the team by clarifying expectations, allocating tasks fairly, and keeping us on schedule. I coordinated weekly meetings and ensured updates in Google Docs were consistent across deliverables. This avoided duplication and ensured our submission reflected a unified effort rather than separate pieces.

At first, I felt pressure balancing leadership with my own deliverables, but I learned that setting structured updates and communicating expectations early made this manageable. This experience also showed me the importance of simplifying project management tools for non-technical audiences, which I will carry into future teamwork and leadership roles.

Balancing this unit with other commitments was challenging, but structured check-ins and shared documents helped us stay on track. If I were to improve, I would dedicate more time to practicing presentation delivery. While my explanations of the WBS and Gantt chart were clear, I could simplify technical details further for broader audiences. This reflection follows Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, moving from describing experiences and evaluating challenges to drawing lessons and planning improvements.

Overall, I would grade my performance as a High Distinction. I would also grade the team's performance as a High Distinction, as we collaborated effectively and delivered a professional outcome.
