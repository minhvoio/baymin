| Participation<br>and<br>collaboration<br>approach | The most<br>effective method: share working documents on Google Drive and<br>communicate through group chat on social platforms such as Instagram. We won't<br>make phone calls as we choose to either communicate in group chat or have<br>in-person meetings. Every member in our team has editor authority in Google Drive<br>and we are free to provide feedback or even make modifications to the other team<br>members' work if we have better ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Communications                                    | We prefer communication through online platforms and only when there are issues<br>with other's work. We will ensure the greatest transparency level as we share<br>common documents for everyone to work with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Problem solving                                   | When there are problems emerging, we will point out the issues within the context<br>and speak to each other politely to ensure a peace environment. We will open our<br>minds to tolerate each other's problems and solve the problems together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Conflict<br>management                            | We treat conflicts as a chance of improvement, if we have conflicts like different<br>thoughts about doing the assignment, we could work out a better solution by<br>communication. If we have conflicts about other issues it could still help us to know<br>our team members better which improves our collaboration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### <span id="page-4-4"></span>1.1 Project Scope Statement

LoopTasks is a scheduling application developed for LifeLoop, in order to make beneficial changes to their clients and users' life while providing a platform to integrate LifeLoop's products into a more seamless experience. With AI enabled, LoopTasks can provide voice reminders, shared calendars, adaptive scheduling and habit tracking for its users to make their life easier.

### <span id="page-4-6"></span><span id="page-4-5"></span>1.2 Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Calendar template

Expected completion date: 10/04/2026

Functional requirements:

- 1. Tasks can be inserted into a certain timeslot and removed.
- 2. Tasks can be directly moved around the calendar
- 3. Calendar syncing with the international calendar and time.

Non-Functional requirements;

- 1. Moving tasks around the calendar should be smooth.
- 2. Users can choose a theme for the calendar with delicate design.

#### <span id="page-5-0"></span>2. Voice reminder module

Expected completion date: 20/05/2026

Functional requirements:

- 1. Users should be able to receive 1 voice reminder 10 minutes prior to the start of a specific task, which is set as default. Users can configure the reminder themselves for each task.
- 2. Voice reminders can be turned off if not wanted

Non-functional requirements:

- 1. Users are allowed to choose different voices (man, woman) and different languages (English, French, Chinese, Punjabi….)
- 2. Voice reminder's speaking speed should neither be too fast or too slow

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>3. Shared calendar function

Expected completion date: 31/05/2026 Functional requirements:

- 1. Users can send a request to other users to share a calendar, others can give permission or reject the request.
- 2. Users can leave the shared calendar at any time, the host of the shared calendar is able to shut down the calendar. Calendar's host can choose to stop sharing the calendar or remove the other users.
- 3. Users can modify the calendar's schedule with the permission given by the calendar's host.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- 1. Each user can customize the decoration of the shared calendar, but only visible to themselves.
- 2. Changes made can be instantly visible to every user.

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span>4. Habit tracking module (AI powered)

Expected completion date: 31/7/2026 Functional Requirements:

- 1. AI will be enabled 2 weeks after the users start their first action on the platform, as AI needs to collect data for learning the user's habits.
- 2. 70% users' data should be used as the training sample, the rest 30% should be used as a testing sample in order to enhance the accuracy of the AI model.
- 3. Ask the users to rate the AI model once a week, the acceptance criteria is 95% satisfaction.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- 1. Only work under users' consent on their data being collected and used.
- 2. Recommend activities based on users' habits on an appropriate timeline.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>Expected completion date: 10/08/2026 Functional Requirements:

- 1. AI will be enabled after 2 weeks, the same as the Habit tracking module.
- 2. AI should develop schedules for users according to their requirements and habits using users' previous schedules.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- 1. The AI-generated schedule should be different from the user's manually-made schedule, and changes to the AI generated schedule are allowed.
- 2. The schedules generated should be reliable and realistic.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>1. Methodology Applied

The cost model was developed using a hybrid estimation approach:

- Bottom-up estimation [\[7\]](https://commons.und.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=cs-fac) was used to estimate the labour cost, from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) tasks we estimated the hours required and from that estimated the labour cost.
- Analogous estimation [\[8\]](https://commons.und.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=cs-fac) was used to compare hourly rates against the Clicks IT [recruitment](https://clicks.com.au/job-salary-search)
- Parametric estimation [\[10\]](https://commons.und.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=cs-fac) was used for hardware and services (e.g., cost per IoT device × quantity, cloud hosting rate × 12 months).

### <span id="page-10-0"></span>2. Labour Cost Assumptions

- Work hours were estimated from WBS deliverables (e.g., 138 hours for Project Manager; 152 hours for Full-Stack Developer).
- Specialists such as AI Engineer (150 hrs) and Cybersecurity Specialist (148 hrs) were given higher rates reflecting market demand for skilled workers.
- Rates ranging from \$69/hr (Quality Assurance Lead) to \$103/hr (Project Manager/Cloud Engineer) which are consistent with industry contractor ranges.
- Most of the time, work is done by developers, designers, and engineers on the project tasks.
- Roles like PM, QA Lead, and BA spend less hands-on time but oversee and validate the work.
- For that reason, the hours are small relative to the project duration, they get involved when necessary and don't do continuous work.

Total Labour Cost = \$143,287.

### <span id="page-10-1"></span>3. Material, Services, and Vendor Costs

- IoT Devices (\$10,000) = 20 units × \$500 each.
- Application Server (\$5,000) and Security Appliance (\$3,000) based on vendor pricing.
- Cloud Hosting (\$24,000) = projected 12-month load with scalability buffer.
- Vendor services (\$50,000) include setup, testing, licensing, and managed services.

Total Materials = \$40,000; Services & Vendors = \$50,000.

### <span id="page-10-2"></span>4. Training and Operational Costs

- Training (\$4,000) = 2 × 1-day workshops × 10 staff × \$200/day.
- Maintenance (\$9,213) = bug fixes, patching, and minor improvements.
- User Guides (\$2,500) for documentation.

### Total Training & Support = \$15,713.

### <span id="page-10-3"></span>5. Contingency Justification

The Risk Register identifies six major risks (R01–R06):

- R01: Staff delays due to limited capacity.
- R02: Technical issues (AI functionality, integration).

- R03: Low user adoption.
- R04: Stakeholder-driven scope changes.
- R05: Cybersecurity incidents.
- R06: Positive risk of higher than expected demand.

Risk register explanation:

- R01 (timeline delays) = additional contractor costs.
- R02 (AI issues) = extra developer/tester workload.
- R04 (scope change) = ~\$20,000 reserve.
- R05 (cybersecurity) = audit/legal costs.

Aggregated exposure from these risks is ≈ \$39,500, equal to ~15% of base project costs.

- A 15% buffer (~\$38k) is insufficient to handle high-impact risks.
- A 17% buffer (~\$51k) would exceed the client's \$300,000 budget cap.
- Therefore, a 17% contingency (\$51,000) was decided:
  - o Provides sufficient coverage
  - o Stays compliant with budget constraints,
  - o Aligns with the reserve allocations documented in the Risk Management Plan.

#### Contingency = \$51,000 (17%).

#### 6. Grand Total

- Base Project Cost = \$249,000
- Contingency (17%) = \$51,000
- Grand Total = \$300,000 (within the \$300,000 client cap)

## <span id="page-12-1"></span>Assumptions for Monthly Allocation

- <span id="page-12-2"></span>1. Direct Dev Labour (\$143,287)
  - o Spread over production phase tasks (Sep 2025 Jul 2026). With a 2 month buffer for any hurdles on the way.
  - o Peaks in months with high development activity: Dec 2025 Mar 2026 and May Jul 2026.
- <span id="page-12-3"></span>2. Support/Materials/Services/Training (\$105,713)
  - o Covers oversight labour, materials, services, training.
  - o Distributed appropriately across months with high production and testing activity.
- <span id="page-12-4"></span>3. Contingency (\$51,000)
  - o Set aside at the end for risk management.
- <span id="page-12-5"></span>4. Monthly Total = Dev Labour + Support/Materials/Services/Training
  - <sup>o</sup> Cumulative spend totals \$249,000 before contingency funds.

#### <span id="page-13-1"></span>6. Project Cost Monitoring and Control [\[11\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/4/1357)

Project costs will be monitored and controlled using milestone-based tracking, monthly reviews, and variance analysis.

Costs will be checked at each major milestone (design approval, database completion, etc) to ensure it aligns with the planned budget.

Every month, cost reviews will compare actual costs against planned allocations, allowing the project team to detect budget overruns early.

If there are differences between actual and planned costs, it will be analyzed through variance analysis, that way we can reallocate resources, adjust schedules, or manage non essential expenses to prevent budget overruns.

This will ensure that the project remains on track financially and that the total does not exceed the approved budget.

## <span id="page-18-1"></span>Reflection

## <span id="page-18-2"></span>Group Reflection

During this project we worked on an AI-powered task management app called LoopTask for our client LifeLoop designed for families and individuals to streamline daily routines. We have had a long period of time developing a project structure including reports, charts, tables and presentations.

For work distribution we decided to split up the tasks to be done individually due to schedules conflicts to work effectively, additionally we hold different opinions on balancing workloads and scheduling regular meetings.

This led to quality issues of the first few parts of the project, such as inconsistent naming, values and more. And since we have different timetables it's been hard for us to actually work together in person.

We were rushing to complete the project prior to the deadline since we spent a significant amount of time modifying deliverables for each other, and even combining duplicated content because of improper workload allocation.

Therefore, we can only reserve or remark on certain parts that are related to other people's work and discuss with them. Luckily we managed to finish our project in time with high quality after we gradually got used to working with each other.

One strategy that helped us succeed was shifting communication to online apps such as Teams/Discord/WhatsApp. This allowed us to share updates without needing to meet in person, which reduced misunderstandings and made collaboration more efficient.

We also allocated tasks based on strengths and weaknesses which resulted in faster and higher quality results, check ups were also done frequently to keep up to date with each other so that everyone is on the same page.

This experience of developing a project structure in a small team could be highly beneficial for our future career since we are going to work with diversified people in the IT industry. We learned how to work productively and efficiently with a group of teammates in which every member holds a different characteristic instead of working alone.

Every member has their own strengths and weaknesses that we can make the best of to make up for others, through this experience we now have a clear understanding that a team charter before starting a project should be crucial, which helps us to get familiar with each other's characteristics and abilities.

In the future when we participate in a working environment, regular meetings and working agreements should not be ignored, since they are the best way to get familiar with teammates.

I identify my characteristics as a communicator and this teamwork experience approved my self identification. I set up the group chat and have been actively posting messages and replying to every teammate, but it has been clear that I lack actual professional skills and always need help when writing documents. For the first 2 weeks of the project I did minimal work since I was busy dealing with my external factors, but continuous communication with all team members helped me to get back quickly and participated in delivering the project in time with high quality.

Along with the project, I have been lacking professional knowledge of this unit at first since unexpected circumstances, but as the project pushes forward, I gradually picked up the unit's knowledge and contributed to our group work. Next time I should continue participating from the start of this project instead of starting halfway.

I wish our team could be communicating more actively next time and everyone should be able to choose their own parts instead of one team member being responsible for task allocating.

Overall I think we did quite well in this project and I hope there could be further improvements in our next teamwork.

Team evaluation: A Self evaluation: B+

This group was formed in the first week applied session class and I joined the group in random selection. When the assignment is released, everybody seems relaxed as no one mentions anything about the assignment. Then, I knew it was the time for me to stand out to help arrange schedules and assign tasks to everyone. However, I tried to be more flexible by not giving a due date for them so I can let them arrange their time. Initially, everyone was quite cooperating. As I was assigning tasks to everyone halfway through the assignment, I found out that one of the teammates started to become less responsive. This had been a problem for us as he was delaying our progress. I tried to ask for reasons, and he only replied he had a quiz, and he needed to prepare for that. It's not reasonable as everyone else also had their tasks to do but they managed to complete their parts before the due date. I think I should change the way I behave and assign tasks as they might not manage their time well. In the future, I will provide them a due date, so they have no excuses and delay our progress. I will also behave stricter to ensure they submit their work on time. (Monash University,n.d.) Throughout the assignment, I think I have done my best to ensure the quality of the work by checking through everyone's parts after they finished and consistent working progress by doing tasks scheduling. Overall, I think we did quite well.

#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>Tien Dat Hoang (33410690)

Early on this project I did not perform as great as I had expected, due to conflict of schedules and work allocation my contributions were often more late than preferred causing stress and uncertainty for my team. So after this setback, I became more engaged and consistent in communicating with the team. I also began volunteering to take on additional tasks and used other member's work as references to produce further deliverables.

At first I was frustrated at myself for my poor time management and guilty for putting unwanted pressure on my group members. Learning from this, after that hurdle I felt more positive as I contributed significantly more and regained the trust of my teammates.

Despite the early challenges caused due to my poor performance, my contributions afterwards were valuable and of good quality. My teammates seemed to acknowledge my improvement, which showed me that I somewhat redeemed my earlier shortcomings.

Something I wished I would have done differently was instead of waiting to be allocated tasks which limited my impact and contribution. I should have been more proactive and be the one to initiate instead.

While I grew into a more reliable and active team member, I still see room for improvement in initiative and leadership. In future projects, I will take more responsibility from the start by proposing task allocations and taking a more leading role.

Self-evaluation: I would give myself a B+, as I overcame a slow start and contributed consistently with good quality work but won't stay satisfied with my current performance and strive to improve.

Team evaluation: I would give my team an A, as despite early coordination issues, we put in notable effort and delivered a strong final outcome.

#### <span id="page-20-1"></span>Nicholas Wongso (34445838)

Working on this project, I faced a few problems since I also had other assignments that I was also doing, resulting in not having enough time to work on this project. I also had few communication issues since me and my teammates just knew each other making it a bit challenging to talk to each other. After we had a few discussions about giving each other tasks to work on, I realized that good communication helps me to communicate effectively and I can also help each other when we encounter difficulties. I also learned that good timing management also helped me to do the tasks efficiently and improve the quality of my work. Looking back, I would have communicated better with my teammates and tried to communicate more especially with the problems I faced when working on my tasks. Another thing that I wished I had done more is managing my time better enabling me to improve my work quality. From this group work, I learned that teamwork requires compromise but also creates opportunities to improve ourselves personally and professionally. Next time, I want to talk to my teammates and manage my time better to improve the quality of my work and contribute more to the team.

Self-evaluation: I would give myself a B+, as I learned to communicate with my teammates and good time management but I also realized that I still have lots of room for improvements

Team evaluation: Overall, I would give our team an A, since we faced the difficulties together and are able to provide good results
