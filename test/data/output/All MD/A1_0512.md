| Team members                       | Sarah Biao, Genevieve Lindsay Wibisono, Ali Azeemi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Team objectives                    | <ul> <li>Achieve an HD (90+) on all assignments.</li> <li>Ideally, hold two meetings a week, either online or in-person subject to all group members' availability.</li> <li>All members attend at least nine out of ten applied classes.</li> </ul>                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Team characteristics               | We are harmonious and synergistic, with each member bringing<br>their own unique value to the team. Our team members' strengths lie<br>in organisation and timeliness, but at the same time, we are<br>occasionally prone to procrastination.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Core values                        | Good collaborations with each team member and achieving/helping<br>nd learning from each other. To succeed in conducting/managing<br>rojects and creating a respectful, organized and collaborative<br>nvironment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Group norms and code<br>of conduct | Constant communication in class and through the Instagram group<br>chat throughout the entire assignment progress, where we will<br>update and help each other on the tasks. We expect everyone to be<br>present and active during meetings as it is ideal for a great team<br>collaboration. Also, we expect everyone to complete their assigned<br>tasks (which will be tailored towards their preferred PM role) by the<br>date discussed. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| Participation and<br>collaboration approach | Organized team meetings with availability provided for each member<br>so we know when each member is available. Catching up with each<br>other through zoom and keeping a google doc or shared document<br>that has checkboxes to show which step we're up to and which<br>tasks are completed. By using Timeline we can record the<br>availability of each member. Keeping a google drive to contain all<br>the work/drafts or past sheets that we have done. We can leave<br>comments for each other on google docs to let each other know the<br>feedback or proof read reports or any other documents that are<br>created to give feedback via text messages or emails.                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communications                              | We will be communicating bi daily through an Instagram group chat.<br>We chose Instagram because all group members are already<br>strongly familiar with it. We will be open and honest with each other.<br>For example, we will not lie about our own skills and abilities, nor will<br>we lie about our weekly availability. Each member will individually<br>handle their own assigned responsibilities for the project, but if a<br>problem that they are unable to solve does appear, they can<br>escalate the problem to the team-level through the Instagram group<br>chat. If the team is still unable to resolve it, the second-level of<br>escalation is the applied class TAs (e.g., Minh Vo). The third-level is<br>the unit coordinator Eehui Lim and the chief examiner<br>SanazNikfalazar. |
| Problem solving                             | We will communicate our problems first. As a team we will discuss<br>and identify the best solution to it. These ideas could give and create<br>solutions to find a way around the problems. For example, we would<br>hold online meetings as the main way to complete the assignments<br>outside of class, not restricting the location to on campus meetings.<br>In any case we have complications on our projects, we will always<br>need to find a way to adapt around the problem, brain-storming for<br>ideas together. Finally, understand that conflict can be a good thing,<br>because it means that the team is engaged and it is an opportunity<br>to discuss different options.                                                                                                               |
| Conflict management                         | We will consider why the conflict might be happening, address any<br>issues raised by input from all members. By doing so, we will make<br>sure to resolve any conflicts and try to do it as soon as possible to<br>avoid conflicts later on. We will always keep open communications<br>with each other and have set and clear expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Digital Wellness Companion Description: A wellness-focused app that helps users track emotional well-being, sleep, hydration, and screen time. It includes gentle nudges, mindfulness exercises, and community challenges. Designed with accessibility and simplicity in mind, LoopCare promotes healthy habits through gamified engagement and personalised insights.

#### **Project Title And Description**

- Provide a short, descriptive title.
- Include a concise summary of what the project is and what it aims to solve.
- Make sure it is distinct from your team name.

Project Title: LoopCare Digital Wellness Companion

Description: A minimalist wellness-focused application to support students' emotional well-being by tracking mood, sleep, hydration, and screen time. Tamagotchi-inspired gamified experience to help keep students motivated.

#### **Project Scope And Objectives**

• State what is **in scope** and what the team will deliver.

- Outline what the product will do and what outcomes are expected.
- Include 3–4 SMART objectives that align with the business case.

Tip: Scope should link directly to your project deliverables in Task 3.3.

What The Project Will Do:

LoopCare Digital Wellness Companion will design, develop and deploy an application that encourages users to track and improve their psychological and physical well-being. The application has four main focuses that will be monitored: the emotional state of users (mood), sleep quality, hydration levels, and screen time. At the same time, the application will provide personalised mindful exercises, community challenges, and gentle reminders. To keep the users motivated to develop positive habits, LoopCare will adopt a tamagotchi-inspired gamified experience.

In Scope:

- Application runs on iOS and Android.
- Six screens within the app: Home, Tracking, Recommendations, Socials, Store, and Settings.
- Integration of data tracking for the emotional state, sleep quality, hydration level and screen time.
- Leveling up your digital pet, earning rewards, and unlocking items in the store once your pet reaches a certain level.
- Personalised task recommendations based on user preference.
- Community features enable adding friends, multiuser challenges and sharing achievements.
- Mobile Accessibility features (in line with WCAG 2.2) ensures the application is accessible to people with disabilities.

Out of Scope:

- Application runs on a web browser.
- Requirements to access devices beyond basic system APIs therefore, third party wearable devices such as Apple Watch are needed.
- Advanced AI providing predictive analytics.
- Connecting / linking the account to an email or phone number.

- Users can select between multiple pets upon creating their account and can buy new pets in the store.

#### SMART Objectives:

- Launch MVP by [date]: Delivering a fully functional MVP of the application with tracking and mindfulness features by the end of the 18-months development cycle.
- Achieve 90% functional coverage: Recurring testing all features outlined in the MVP ensuring that the core functionalities are fully developed and passing the acceptance criteria before release date.
- User Engagement Goal: Attain at least 60% active user engagement (measured by at least two logins per week) within the first month of launch through the game features and gentle nudges.
- Accessibility Compliance: Attaining WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards for accessibility to provoke inclusivity for diverse users by the end of development phase.

#### **Project Start And Finish Dates**

- Define the intended duration of the project.
- Use a realistic project timeline (e.g. October 2025 to February 2026).
- Tie this to your Gantt chart and schedule from Task 3.4.

#### Intended duration: 205 days.

- Project timeline: Jan 1, 2026 to Jul 25, 2026
- Note: Buffer periods have already been taken into account and included in the intended duration in case of contingencies.

#### Maintenance and support duration: 365 days.

- Maintenance and support timeline: Jul 25, 2026 to Jul 25, 2027
- Note: The client was considering up to 18 months of maintenance and support, but in the end, decided on 12 months.

#### Gantt chart and schedule: See Task 3.4

#### High-Level Budget Estimate

- Provide the total estimated project cost (not detailed breakdown).
- You can base this on your cost model from Task 3.5 (e.g. \$480,000).
- Indicate if the budget is capped or flexible.

High-level budget Estimate:

The maximum overall estimated cost for the LoopCare Digital Wellness Companion project is \$300,000. This budget is the limit, meaning that project activities must be maintained and presented within this financial limit. This covers the design, development, testing, deployment, and initial marketing, as well as project management and contingency allowances.

#### **Project Development Approach**

- State whether you are using Waterfall, Agile, or a Hybrid approach.
- Justify your choice briefly (e.g. Agile allows iterative testing with students).
- Align with PMBOK 7 and Monash preferences for adaptive delivery.

#### Project Development Approach:

The LoopCare Digital Wellness Companion will be developed using the Agile methodology, with recurring and incremental delivery cycles (sprints). Agile is selected due to its flexible planning, continuous user feedback, and rapid iteration, allowing the application to be developed along with changing user requirements and continuous feedback from students.

This approach aligns with PMBOK 7 principles of adaptability, stakeholders engagement, and value deliverance. Moreover, it achieves Monash's preference for malleable presentations, ensuring early prototyping, frequent interactions and testing with targeted users, and utilising feedback for guidance and development.

#### **Key Stakeholders**

List at least 4–5 key stakeholders and their roles:

- Client or sponsor
- Product owner (team contact)

## 5 Scope Statement

#### 1.1 Project Scope Statement

[Provide a high-level description of the project's purpose, objectives, and major deliverables.]

LoopCare is an accessible mobile application designed to promote students' mental and physical well-being. The main purpose of this app is to allow users to track their mood, sleep quality, hydration levels, and screen time. To keep users engaged and consistent, we have inspired this application by Tamagotchi, a gamified experience where users take care of their pets as they complete their set goals.

This project aims to design, develop and deploy a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for iOS and Android platforms within 18 months. This wellness tracking app will also provide personalized mindfulness exercises and insights. The goal for this app is to encourage wellness habits through gamification, accessibility and personalized insights.

More detailed breakdown of the labour and the material costs:

Justifications and Assumptions:

Methods used:

- Bottom up estimation:

-Applied for a detailed line-by-line breakdown of all project costs, including labour, materials, services, and contingencies. Each WBS level 2 item was estimated individually and then aggregated to calculate the overall level 1 costs.

- Analogous Estimation:

- Used historical project data and market comparison to benchmark labour and vendor costs. This ensures estimates aligns with realistic industry status

- Parametric Estimation:

- Applied unit rates, such as cost per labour hour, cost per PCs and cost per server license, to calculate costs based on duration.

#### Assumptions:

Labor Cost:

- The majority of project effort will be spent on the development phase, so more developers are required: 4-6 developers in total, including both front-end and back-end developers.
- 3 UX/UI developers are assumed to work on projects for the design phases.
- The project duration exceeds one year, requiring up to 3 project managers to some staff may be part-time.
- An allowance of 5% of total labour hours is included for sick leave, meetings, and administrative tasks.
- Given the scale of the project is small to medium, the limited time is 18 months max and the cap budget at \$300,000 project director, project coordinator and business analyst is not required. As PM (project manager) is able to handle a project at this scale.
- There are other roles in the technology field that are not required. Due to the scale of the project and the constraints set.

#### Material cost:

- Hardware includes PCs for developers and testers, while servers are included in hosting costs.
- Software licenses are required according to the number of users and duration of the project. Especially Figma that allows designers to design low fidelity to high fidelity prototypes with its licences. That enables cost efficiencies.
- Cloud hosting is calculated based on a monthly rate multiplied by 12 months.

#### Services and Vendors:

- Third-part services are budgeted based on vendor rates per hour and estimated hours multiplied by the standard hourly rate.
- Includes cloud management for the cloud hosting.

#### Contingency:

- A 17% contingency is included to cover unforeseen costs, including scope changes, delays, or unexpected price fluctuations in materials, services, or labor.

#### Overheads:

- Indirect costs, such as administration, facilities, and miscellaneous expenses, are considered part of the contingency or embedded in labour/material estimates.

Linking cost estimation to WBS and pie chart:

The level 1 and level 2 WBS items formed the foundation of the cost estimation. Each level 2 item (e.g., project manager, UX/UI designers, front-end developers, etc), was estimated individually using bottom up methods, then aggregated to produce level 1 totals for labour, materials, services and maintenance, and contingency. These total represented the level 1 pie chart, which illustrates the proportional distribution of costs across major project categories. By aligning cost assumptions such as labour hours, rates and material quantities with each WBS element, the chart provides a clear, justified, and easily interpretable overview of how each resources and expenditures are allocated across the project. This ensures transparency, supports budget planning and allows stakeholders to quickly identify the major cost drivers.

#### Cost Baseline:

The cost baseline is a time-phased budget that maps planned expenditure to each month of the project. It will be presented as a monthly cost table showing planned spend, cumulative spend, and percentage of total budget.

Is it easy to visualise how spending is distributed across the project timeline? Do baseline numbers match the overall cost model? Does the baseline highlight any periods of significant spending?

Describe how the project costs will be monitored and controlled over time. Outline a budget tracking approach, such as:

Milestone-based cost tracking (tracking expenses at major project

milestones).

- Monthly cost reviews to ensure the budget remains on track.
- Variance analysis to detect any potential budget overruns.

The cost baseline model and the line graph shown above has represented the approved time-phased budget \$300,000 spread across the 18 months project duration. The monthly cost table clearly illustrates how expenditure is distributed, showing planned spend, cumulative speed, and percentage of the overall budget.

The baseline numbers reconcile with the overall cost model, ensuring that all WBS items are fully captured. It is easy to visualise cost distribution:

Initiation (Months 1-2): A significant spike occurs due to upfront equipment purchases (PCs and licences), accounting for over \$40,000 in early spend.

Design and Development (Months 7-12): This is the peak spending period, driven by front-end and back-end developer effort, totaling approximately \$119,000.

Testing (Months 13-14): Another noticeable spike of around \$40,000 arises from QA and regression testing activities.

Support and Hosting (Months 7-18): Costs flatten out but remain steady through cloud hosting, post-launch support, and contingency allocations.

Overall, the baseline highlights that the bulk of expenditure is concentrated in development and QA, while initiation and closure phases carry smaller but distinct peaks.

Monitoring and Control Approach

Project costs will be monitored and controlled using the following methods:

Milestone-based cost tracking: At the completion of each major phase (Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Support), actual costs will be compared against the baseline.

Monthly Cost reviews: The Project Manager will review monthly spend against the cost baseline, reconciling invoices, labour hours, and material purchases.

Variance analysis: Variances exceeding over 10% will be escalated, with corrective actions such as adjusting resourcing, reallocation contingency, or rescheduling tasks.

Cumulative cost tracking: An S-curve will be used to monitor burn rate over time and provide early warning of overspending or underspending.

Reporting: Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques, including Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI), will be applied to access cost and schedule efficiency. Findings will be reported to stakeholders during monthly governance meetings.

This approach ensures that the project budget remains controlled, deviations are detected early, and spending is aligned with the approved baseline throughout the 18-month lifecycle.

### **10 Group Reflection**

At the beginning of planning our project, we agreed on some ground rules in our working agreement, like keeping in touch with each other regularly, sharing the workload fairly and being upfront if anything wasn't going according to the plan. Having that in writing gave us something to come back to whenever things weren't as organised and it really helped us to get back on track.

When it came to leading the team, Sarah naturally took on the role, guiding the team through tasks and keeping us focused on deadlines. Lindsay took the lead when working on the Gantt chart and various other tasks, while Ali guided the RTM and scheduling. Spa contributed on various tasks including helping with the pitch preparation as well as keeping the team motivated during meetings. Even though the leadership wasn't split evenly, Sarah's consistency gave the team a clear direction and others stepped in where their strengths matched the task.

Support was really a big part of why our group ran smoothly. We used our instagram group chat almost everyday to check in with each other and share updates. If someone was behind on a particular task, others would step in to help. Google docs were also a really big part in working on the task simultaneously and fixing any mistakes. One example was when the dates between the charter and the Gantt chart didn't line up, instead of blaming each other feedback was given from members and the problem was fixed.

There were moments where our thoughts might've not been the same at the start especially around what should be included in or excluded from the scope. But going back to the project constraints - 18 month deadline and \$300k budget, it helped to make clearer decisions. We also leaned on our working agreement to talk openly and solve problems together and move forward once a choice is made. This made things respectful and prevented small talk.

If we were to improve, we'd focus on managing our time more evenly. Too much work was pushed closer to the deadline, which added pressure. Setting earlier internal deadlines within the group would give us more space to produce quality and time to review. Overall, the project ran smoothly and as expected overall. This project showed us how study leadership, mutual support, and honest communication can make teamwork productive and enjoyable.

# **11 Individual Reflection**

### Sarah (33906955):

As the planner of our group, my main responsibility was to organise tasks, assign work to members, and monitor time needed for each activity. This reflection outlines my personal experience, challenges, and learning outcomes while working with my team.

During our first assignment, I contributed primarily by organising tasks, creating the required documentations, preparing powerpoint presentation and completing the cost model. These responsibilities reflects my role as the planner, prioritising tasks based on deadlines and ensuring smooth coordination among team members. Through this process, I have developed my skills in scheduling and delegating tasks effectively.

However, I faced challenges such as managing my other coursework alongside this assignment and adapting to a project that is less realistic. These difficulties highlighted the importance of flexibility and time management. I also realised the value of breaking large tasks into manageable segments to avoid bottlenecks.

From this experience, I learned the practical application of the project lifecycle, cost modeling, and task prioritisation in a team setting. Reflecting critically, I recognise that while I contributed effectively, I could improve by balancing work loads more evenly and adopting proactive communication strategies.

Overall, I would assign myself a grade of D, acknowledging both my contribution and areas for growth. I would also grade the team as D, recognising that while we collaborated well, improvement in time management and task allocations are needed. In future assignments, I plan to split tasks amongst members to work independently while coordinating deliverables. This method should enhance efficiency to team performance.

### Ali Azeemi (33843309):

For me, working on this project has been a mix of challenging and rewarding moments. Overall, it has been a good learning experience. I mostly worked on the RTM and on the scheduling side of things, I enjoyed the structure of those tasks and made sure they linked to the WBS and the scope. The team valued this, but I know I could've spoken more in some design discussions instead of holding back.

One thing I noticed about myself is that I can be reliable when I have a clear task I am working on, but I sometimes lean on others to lead the way. For example, Sarah was driving a lot of the project and I followed along instead of throwing in more of my ideas. I think a part of that comes from juggling uni assignments and deadlines with my work. Which meant most times I worked closer to the edge than I should have.

However, what worked really well is that we communicated the tasks well. Instagram chat and google doc kept us all in sync and made it very easy to share feedback quickly with each other without wasting time. What didn't work so well was leaving too much until last week, which created unnecessary stress. Next time, I'd like to set up my own deadlines and be more active in conversations.

For myself I would give myself a D, for the team I would give us a B. We had a really strong support connection.

### Spa M (33728119):

In the first seven weeks of this semester, my team and I worked on Assignment 1 of FIT2002. The assignment focused on applying project management skills to develop a project for our client LifeLoop. Our team agreed on LoopCare for our project, a student wellness app.

I found the assignment to be eye-opening but overwhelming. At the beginning, I dreaded having to work on a group assignment – at the end, I felt grateful to be a part of the team. I appreciated Sarah's leadership — I believe the other members also feel the same.

Our team communicated effectively. We regularly discussed with each other via Instagram. When we had a question that the other members could not answer (e.g., if the maintenance period should be included in the WBS), I escalated it to our TA.

Transparency between what members were working on was lacking, and I often found myself confused about my responsibilities. If I was more knowledgeable in project management, I could have better split the group into self-organising teams.

We were more comfortable with working individually than in a group, which sometimes led to members working on a task without feedback from others. This was our first experience with documenting an IT project, and considering we were developing an imaginary product, it was challenging and ambiguous.

In conclusion, I would give my team and myself a D. I have come to enjoy working in a team, and now better understand the project lifecycle. For future assignments, I would use Trello for transparency. Going forward, I need to seek out opportunities through PMI certifications to develop my project management skills.

### Genevieve W (34445668):

By being the innovator of the group, I was responsible to bring new ideas, creative solutions, and ways to approach the assignment. For our first assignment, I contributed by providing ideas and helped with tasks such as scope statement, Gantt chart, and project risk management to ensure that we all finish the task on time. I also contributed to the gamification aspect of our project, which made our work more unique and engaging.

I struggled with managing my time as I had other projects and tests from other units. This caused me to finish some tasks later than expected, adding pressure as deadliness is

nearing. I felt stressed knowing my delays can slow down the team's progress. I also felt guilty for not handling my responsibilities as efficiently as I could've.

Although I had completed my tasks, I was disappointed that they felt rushed due to my procrastination. My delays could've negatively impacted the team if we had fallen behind schedule.

This experience showed me the importance of proper time management and planning. If I had organised my time better, I could have produced higher-quality work and reduced stress for myself and the group. Working with my teammates helped us stay on track each week and avoid rushing on the due date.

I would assign myself a grade of D for my contributions and the team with D as we could have improved with better implemented time management as a whole. To conclude, I learned that effective scheduling and clear task planning are crucial to managing multiple assignments. In future assignments, I will create a personal timeline, set deadlines, and regularly communicate my progress with my team.
