| Problem<br>solving     | If a team member encounters a problem they cannot solve individually, they<br>will inform the rest of the team.

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Task 3.2.1 – Project Charter**

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>*Project Title and Description:*

The project's title is "LifeLoop Labs' App Management", and what we want to achieve is to create an app that will serve as a hub that standardises accessibility audits, user testing protocols, design system creation, and prototyping tools for all LifeLoop apps.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>*Project Scope and Objectives:*

- In scope and what will be delivered:
  - A central platform for accessibility audits, usability testing protocols, design system creation, and prototyping tools for the LifeLoop app teams and users.
  - Pilot deployment with designated LifeLoop pilot app team, delivering the templates portal, the browser extension for automated usability/accessibility tests and feedback capture, and the analytics dashboard where aggregate metrics (for example, average time to complete task and number of crashes) can be seen.
- What the product will do:
  - Give developers consistent system design rules to cut reworks.
  - Let testers run standardised, auditable usability and accessibility checks.
  - Capture user feedback on prototype and deployed apps in one place to speed up decision making.
  - Overall, the app will produce faster handoffs, fewer usability inconsistencies, and more accessible and intuitive releases that will allow for more customer trust and loyalty.
- SMART Objectives:
  - Obtain 80% satisfaction from the developers/testers in the post-pilot surveys while upholding a schedule variance of ≤10% against the approved baseline.
  - Within the pilot period, reduce design to developer handoff times by ≥20% and lower costs by ≥15% compared to baseline.
  - By the launch date in February 2027, launch the application and deliver the 4 main core modules, meeting 100% of the RTM and pass ≥90% on our accessibility checklist and user testing.

#### <span id="page-4-3"></span>*Project start and finish dates:*

Intended duration of 18 months, from August 2025 to February 2027.

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>*High level project budget information:*

\$300,000 AUD total (capped). Up to 10% for management reserve.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>*Project manager's name and contact information:*

Balqis Kinanti Haldi Heryputri – bher0013@student.monash.edu

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span>*Main Project Success Criteria:*

- Finish with maximum 10% schedule variance against the approved baseline and total spend of a maximum of \$300k.
- During the pilot, achieve at least a 20% reduction in design-to-dev handoff time and a minimum of 15% reduction in delivery cost versus the current workflow baseline.
- Meet 100% of the RTM acceptance criteria, deploy the deliverable with no critical defects, achieve at least a 90% pass on the accessibility checklist, and obtain at least 80% positive developer and tester ratings on the usability and intuitiveness of the deliverable.

#### <span id="page-5-3"></span>*Project development approach:*

- **Approach:** Agile
- **Reasoning:** our usability and accessibility requirements will evolve as developers and testers trial the deliverables. Agile lets us prototype early, gather feedback frequently, and adjust with minimal rework.

### ● **Alignment with PMBOK 7 & Monash:**

- Principles: tailoring and value delivery through short iterations and stakeholder engagement.
- Performance domains: stakeholders (regular demonstrations), planning (per sprint), delivery (incremental, Definition of Done via RTM), measurement (track schedule variance and satisfaction), uncertainty (active risk review).
- **Monash:** emphasis on adaptive learning, iterative cycles, demonstrations, and traceability (DoD through RTM).

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>**Task 3.3.2 – Scope Statement**

#### <span id="page-7-2"></span>*Purpose, Boundaries and Major Deliverables*

The purpose of the LifeLoop Usability Management App is to create a centralised platform for all LifeLoop applications that standardises usability practices. We are committed to addressing the challenges that many applications in the current market face - failing to meet user expectations, increased costs, wasted time and loss of customer trust. By embedding usability into every stage of the app development lifecycle, we are confident that these challenges can be overcome.

The purpose of the application is to serve as a central hub for:

- Accessibility audits
- User testing protocols

- Creation of system designs
- Prototyping tools

### **Boundaries:**

- The app will cover usability, accessibility workflows, design systems creation and prototyping tools.
- Features that are not directly related to the attributes mentioned above are excluded from the scope of this project (e.g. hub for cost analysis of LifeLoop Apps).

### **Major Deliverables:**

- A centralised usability management (including analytics report) application and extension
- Integrated accessibility and user testing frameworks
- Prototyping tools/templates
- Reusable design system (UI components, templates, style guides)
- Documentation and training resources

This project aims to deliver a working solution within 18 months, with the allocated budget of \$300,000. This will be accomplished using the Agile methodology to minimise risks and adapt quickly to feedback.

According to KVY Technology's software development timeline guide, requirements gathering often takes 2-4 weeks depending on project complexity. Allocating 28 days here provides enough time for stakeholder interviews, user story mapping, and documenting functional and non-functional requirements. This reduces the risk of scope creep later. (*How Long Does It Take to Build Your Software? A Comprehensive Guide 2024*, 2024b)

By 23 October 2025, all functional and non-functional requirements will be gathered, reviewed, and signed off, providing a stable baseline for design and preventing scope creep.

UI/UX Design is scheduled for about 2 months, which aligns with KVY Technology's estimate that design can take around 5 weeks depending on complexity. This phase allows for wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing, before development begins, ensuring the app is user-centered and reducing costly redesigns later.

By 22 January 2026, the UI/UX design will be finalised, providing prototypes and design system guidelines so developers can build with a consistent, accessible user experience in mind.

Running in parallel with UI/UX design, system design requires around 2.5 months. Based on a Reddit thread on system design timeline (Reddit, 2023), the architectural design stage typically takes 3-6 months for medium to large systems. This period is essential for database schema design, API architecture, security frameworks, and integration planning. Overlapping with UI/UX ensures both technical and design specifications align.

By 12 February 2026, the technical stack, system architecture, database schemas, classes and module specifications will be completed, giving developers a clear blueprint to follow and mitigating technical risks.

*Phase 4: Development*

Development is the longest phase (~10 months), which aligns with KVY Technology's estimate that building a full-featured application usually takes 2–12 months, depending on complexity and team size. This time frame accommodates iterative development using agile sprints, ensuring working product increments are delivered incrementally and tested continuously.

By 24 December 2026, the application will be fully built and consistently tested, giving stakeholders a tangible product to do a final user acceptance testing and confirm against requirements.

### *Phase 5: Quality Assurance (UAT)*

| 99  | = 6.0 Testing and Quality Assurance                                                                       | 19 days | 24/12/26, 8:00 an | 19/1/27, 5:00 pm  |     |

Nearly 3 weeks are allocated for QA and User Acceptance Testing. KVY Technology emphasizes that proper testing can take 3–6 weeks, depending on scope. Given the extended development phase, this shorter but focused UAT period makes sense if testing was integrated throughout development (agile testing cycles), leaving this stage mainly for end-to-end validation and stakeholder sign-off.

By 20 January 2027, the system will be validated against user and business needs, ensuring usability, accessibility, and performance standards are met and obtaining stakeholder sign-off for release.

### *Phase 6: Deployment and Launch*

The 11 day deployment window is justified because KVY Technology notes that deployment often takes hours to days. This includes environment setup, migration, security verification, and go-live checks. This timeframe also provides a buffer for rollback and minor fixes.

By 4 February 2027, the application will be launched, formally delivering the solution to end users and achieving the project's primary objective of standardising accessibility and usability processes across all Lifeloop Apps.

## *Phase 7: Project Closure*

Project closure emphasizes documenting lessons learned, final reporting, and administrative wrap-up. This short but crucial phase ensures the project is formally handed over and evaluated for future improvements. The red paths determines the critical path of the project which takes the longest duration.

By 12 February 2027, the project will be formally closed with stakeholder approval, documentation handover, and transfer ownership to the corresponding operations team. This ensures all deliverables are fulfilled, and the system can move into a business-as-usual support.

### <span id="page-15-1"></span>*Contingency Costs*

A 7% buffer is applied to account for uncertainties such as schedule overruns, scope changes, or unforeseen technical challenges. While industry practice often applies 5-10% (Doug, 2024), the project adopts 7% because risks are mitigated through the use of established frameworks, vendor outsourcing for specialised roles (e.g., DevOps, Data Analyst), and leveraging cloud-based services. This lower buffer keeps the budget controlled while still providing reasonable protection against risk exposure.

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>**Task 3.5.2 – Cost Estimation Methodology And Justification**

## <span id="page-16-1"></span>*Cost Estimation Methodology*

Personnel costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach based on WBS tasks, hours, and hourly rates. Hardware costs were estimated using analogous estimation by referencing vendor price lists for comparable servers and routers. Software licenses and cloud hosting followed a parametric approach, multiplying vendor unit rates by the required number of users and months. Vendor services were estimated using analogous market benchmarks. A 7% contingency was applied to the baseline costs to account for risks.

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>*Justify All Key Assumptions*

Hourly rates for each role were derived from the HAYS Salary Guide and IT Contractor Benchmarks. These rates reflect typical market values for IT professionals in Melbourne and ensure alignment with industry standards. Where external source was chosen, contractor rates were benchmarks against managed service providers, recognising that highly specialised skills are often more cost-efficient when sourced externally on a short-term basis.

Labours hours were estimated using a bottom-up approach, linking directly to WBS tasks and durations. Each role was treated as a single resource for estimation purposes, with effort calculated as (task duration)\*(8 hours/day). In practice, multiple personnel may be assigned to balance workload and shorten duration. However, the aggregate effort\*The rate remains unchanged.

For example, Project Manager hours were adjusted to reflect overlapping tasks in WBS 3.0 and 4.0 to avoid duplication. Also, 4.8 and 5.8 run in parallel with the rest of 4.0 and 5.0 features respectively, so the working hours were halved rather than duplicating full development time. Agile and automation practices were assumed to reduce overall labour effort by up to 30%-50%, consistent with industry studies. After evaluating hourly costs of data analysts and devops engineers and recognising the efficiency gains achievable through outsourcing to specialised contractors, we opted to externalise these roles. Contracting these resources allows us to reduce overall labour hours while maintaining high-quality outputs in their respective domains.

Software followed a parametric approach: subscription-based licenses, calculated as (unit cost)\*(users)\*(18months). These tools were selected for widely adopted in industry and they are compatible with project scope.

Cloud hosting costs were reduced by leveraging AWS/Azure/GCP free tier credits and small instance configurations, allocating only \$4000 for the full project.

Services & vendor costs were streamlined and installation and setup largely handled internally by the devops contractor and tech lead. Licensing was excluded here to avoid duplication, since all software subscriptions are already captured in the software category.

The application will be deployed on cloud to support approximately 400 users, requiring scalable hosting services to ensure availability, usability, and performance under expected demand.

# <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Task 3.5.3 – Cost Baseline**

The cost baseline is presented as a monthly distribution over the 18 months project timeline, with expenditures aligned to WBS tasks, which is easy to visualise the spent. Labour costs dominate in every phase because of the labour-intensive project. Hardware appeared as one-off while software licensing has recurring costs distributed evenly across the project lifecycle. Vendor and setup, IT contractors occur when needed.

The monitor and control costs, a monthly cost review approach will be adopted. At the end of each month, actual costs will be compared to baseline allocations for that period. Variances will be tracked and analysed, enabling corrective actions such as reallocation of labour hours, deferral of discretionary vendor expenses, or utilisation of contingency reserves. This method ensures timely detection of overruns while maintaining alignment with project cash flow and schedule milestones.

# <span id="page-18-1"></span>**Task 3.6 – Risk Management Plan**

### **Risk Management Process**

To ensure the LifeLoop Usability Management App runs smoothly, our team developed a Risk Management Plan. We collaborated together to identify, analyse, prioritise and place for risks that could affect the project.

### **Risk Identification**

The team used brainstorming sessions, scenario planning and root cause analysis to help identify any potential risks. Both internal risks, such as technical challenges and team workload and sudden unavailability, and external risks, such as stakeholder availability or changes in usability requirements were considered. Using our considerations, we created a risk register with a few key risks.

#### **Risk Analysis**

Each risk was analysed to determine how likely it was to happen and what impact it would have on the overall project. Each risk was discussed by the team to make sure everyone agreed on the assessment of each one.

#### **Risk Prioritisation**

We prioritised each risk based on their potential to disrupt the project, which was displayed using a probability-impact matrix.

# <span id="page-22-0"></span>**Task 4.1 – Group Reflection**

Our team has demonstrated good collaboration, structure, and innovation throughout the project. By leveraging our diverse strengths in communication and critical thinking, we have effectively coordinated tasks, resolved challenges, and ensured high-quality deliverables. Each member contributed according to their strengths: Balqis led the Gantt chart, Josefina led the Project Charter, Team Working Agreement, and RTM, Hsin Chieh led the Cost Breakdown and Cost Baseline, and Michael led the Risk Management and the Scope Statement. This division of responsibilities allowed us to work efficiently and maintain accountability.

Weekly meetings which are done in person every Thursday 10am and daily updates on WhatsApp ensured transparency and alignment. Tasks were tracked using a working task tracker above, which clearly shows who is responsible for each task and their progress. All team members reviewed sections as soon as possible, enabling timely feedback, iterative improvement, and consistent progress. Google Drive was used to share and collaborate on documents, ensuring a centralized and accessible workspace.

Our team values are communication, transparency, respect, honesty, excellence, and integrity. These guided our interactions and helped us navigate challenges. For instance, delays in response time or unclear ideas were addressed through quick calls, respectful discussion, and, if needed, majority voting. Issues such as potential blockers were promptly shared, discussed, and resolved collaboratively.

Despite occasional delays in responses and differences in communication styles, our team's strengths enabled us to overcome obstacles. By supporting each other's ideas, clarifying misunderstandings, and applying constructive feedback, we maintained cohesion and focus on project goals. Members took responsibility for their tasks, communicated blockers transparently, and assisted others when needed, ensuring that no task was left incomplete.

Overall, our collaboration fostered an environment where each member could contribute fully and learn from one another. Leadership was shared organically, support was consistently available, and feedback was applied constructively. Conflict resolution strategies, including open discussion, voting, and temporary breaks, helped us navigate disagreements respectfully and maintain team harmony. Our structured, communicative, and transparent approach, reinforced by the task tracker, directly influenced positive project outcomes and demonstrates the mutual understanding developed throughout the project.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Task 4.2 – Individual Reflections**

#### *Balqis Kinanti Haldi Heryputri*

<span id="page-23-1"></span>At the beginning of the project, I think that our team felt disorganised and I am unsure of where to start. The project seemed overwhelming with new terms and unfamiliar concepts, and I initially found it difficult to understand the group dynamics. Scheduling meetings was also a challenge, which slowed progress. I realised that dividing tasks fairly among team members was essential so we could move forward without waiting for everyone's availability, while still having collective discussions to ensure a shared understanding. Personally, I was also responsible for delivering the pitch, which pushed me outside of my comfort zone as public speaking has never been my strength.

During the project, I felt frustrated when tasks seemed unevenly distributed and demotivated when a tutor commented that he "expected more" from our team. This lowered my morale and made me worry about letting others down. However, over time I learnt to be more flexible and to trust my teammates. By dividing responsibilities, the group began to make steady progress. The pitch, although challenging, gave me confidence and resilience, while the tutor's criticism became an opportunity to reflect on how we could improve both as a group and individually.

Reflecting on the experience, I recognised the value of embracing challenges such as presentations and external criticism as learning opportunities. Next time, I would establish clearer workload distribution earlier, initiate regular checkins to maintain alignment, and practise public speaking in smaller contexts to build confidence. Lastly, I would give myself and the team a HD on this project as we have put in our best effort and I personally contributed on the Gantt chart, presentations, and pitch.

#### *Josefina Retondo Rojas*

<span id="page-23-2"></span>We prepared project management deliverables to propose an app/extension that manages other LifeLoop Lab Apps. Across seven weeks, I worked alongside my 3 people team, meeting online and on-campus. Early coordination was messy due to different schedules, but organization improved as we got to know each other better. My main responsibility was the project charter and RTM, which I approached carefully, knowing that these are the base for the entire project. Although I had prior knowledge (FIT1055, FIT2001, FIT2101, this was my first practical exposure to cost analysis and such detailed planning.

I felt secure and motivated because the workload was more fairly shared than previous teams I work with. The uniqueness of our pitch idea reinforced this motivation, as no one in the class chose the same idea. Still, I experienced moments of uncertainty about the scope, but discussing with teammates clarified our direction.

The experience revealed both strengths and weaknesses. I successfully applied my knowledge of Agile framework/principles, stakeholder mapping, and requirement management were needed. However, I would've liked to establish a clearer work distribution early on and check on teammates' progress, rather than remaining focused on my tasks.

From this, I learned the importance of balancing accountability with proactive team support. In future projects, I plan to ask more questions early, monitor task dependencies, and share progress consistently to improve outcomes and team cohesion.

I would give myself and the team a HD, as we all accomplished our parts to the best of our ability and really put in the effort to deliver something we're proud of.

#### *Hsin-Chieh Yang*

<span id="page-24-0"></span>Throughout this unit, I was exposed to the complete cycle of project management deliverables, beginning with the Project Charter, RTM, and Project Scope Statement, followed by the Gantt Chart and, later, cost-focused activities such as cost analysis, estimation, the cost model, and the cost baseline. My main contribution was centred on the cost components, which allowed me to understand how detailed assumptions, estimation methods, and baseline allocation are essential in balancing project scope and budget.

At the beginning, our group faced some uncertainty. Roles were not clearly defined, and it was sometimes unclear how to categorise work or what exactly we were expected to deliver. Over time, however, our team adjusted, clarified responsibilities, and gradually returned to a more structured workflow. While this process was challenging, it reflected the reality of project environments, where ambiguity must be resolved through communication and adaptation.

Weekly meetings with group members provided opportunities to align progress, although at times they were inefficient, with some members working on tasks during the meeting itself. In retrospect, our efficiency could be improved if tasks had been allocated more clearly at the start, leaving meetings to focus on resolving problems rather than performing work.

Overall, I believe I gained valuable experience, both in applying project management tools and in learning how teamwork evolves. The unit highlighted the importance of clear planning, structured communication, and adaptability, which I expect will benefit me in future projects.

#### *Michael Reginald*

<span id="page-24-1"></span>At the start of the project, I felt uncertain about how to approach the tasks, as the project management deliverables such as risk registers and scope statements were new to me. Initially, the workload was overwhelming, and I struggled to balance attention to detail while keeping on task and on schedule. Scheduling meetings with the team also posed a challenge, as I was not consistently available due to other commitments.

My main contributions were developing the project scope statements and risk management plan. These tasks required me to define boundaries, deliverables and constraints while also identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies. I found this rewarding, as I enjoy structured planning, but at times I became too focused on details, which at times made me take longer to complete my work. Despite this, I learned to trust the team process and rely on others to carry different responsibilities, which helped us move forward more effectively.

Through this experience, I developed stronger skills in identifying risks and understanding how scope definition shapes a project's success. I also realised the importance of concise communications when explaining technical information to teammates. In future projects, I want to practice delivering my ideas more clearly and work on balancing thoroughness with efficiency.

Overall, I am proud of my contribution and collective effort of the group. I would give myself a B+, as there is room for significant improvement. I would give the team a HD, as we overcame many internal and external challenges to deliver high quality outcomes.
