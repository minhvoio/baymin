| Group<br>norms<br>and<br>code<br>of<br>conduct            | We will all equally contribute to group work and ensure we complete<br>assignments in a timely manner. When completing an assignment we will<br>identify what needs to be completed and divide the work evenly. We will<br>make sure to discuss and critique the work done by all to ensure everyone is<br>content with the standard and quality of work.                                                                                                                 |  |
| Participation<br>and<br>collaboration<br>approach         | We consider using text messages and early-informed meetings to discuss the<br>project and individual progression. Platforms like Google Drive and Trello<br>would also be considered to effectively collaborate with the team. Feedbacks<br>would be provided during the meeting sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                |  |

| Problem<br>solving                                        | We will strive to communicate anything that impedes our ability to complete<br>our part of the group work and work to create a solution. We will also try to<br>complete parts of the assignment in advance of the due date to account for<br>any unforeseen circumstances. As for differing opinions on the direction we<br>take in the assignment could involve a discussion about the pros and cons of<br>the viable options and we would then discuss how to proceed. |  |
| Conflict<br>management                                    | If any conflict happens within the team we plan to have a group discussion on<br>the reasons for having different perspectives and vote it out, thereby giving<br>everyone's opinion a fair and equal chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |
