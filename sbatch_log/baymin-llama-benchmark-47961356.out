--------------------------------
A. Yes - conditioning on K, U1, G, E, L, G1, M1, P, E1, J, H1, L1, Q, X1, F1, C2, O1, H, M, T1, X, F2, I1, B1, D1, H2, F, V, I, P1, C, D2, W, A2, D, S1, A1, E2, B, Y1, Z1, T, Z, R1, S, J1, B2, A, Q1, Y changes the dependency between N1 and R. Before observing K, U1, G, E, L, G1, M1, P, E1, J, H1, L1, Q, X1, F1, C2, O1, H, M, T1, X, F2, I1, B1, D1, H2, F, V, I, P1, C, D2, W, A2, D, S1, A1, E2, B, Y1, Z1, T, Z, R1, S, J1, B2, A, Q1, Y, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they are d-separated. This happens because the path from N1 to R goes through G1 as a chain. Observing G1 blocks the chain: N1 → G1 → H → R.
--------------------------------
B. Yes - conditioning on K, U1, G, E, L, G1, M1, P, E1, J, H1, L1, Q, X1, F1, C2, O1, H, M, T1, X, F2, I1, B1, D1, H2, F, V, I, P1, C, D2, W, A2, D, S1, A1, E2, B, Y1, Z1, T, Z, R1, S, J1, B2, A, Q1, Y changes the dependency between N1 and R.

After observing all evidence, they are d-separated. This happens because the path from N1 to R is a common effect (collider) of G1 as a chain. Observing G1 opens the path: N1 → G1 → H → R.
--------------------------------
C. No - conditioning on K, U1, G, E, L, G1, M1, P, E1, J, H1, L1, Q, X1, F1, C2, O1, H, M, T1, X, F2, I1, B1, D1, H2, F, V, I, P1, C, D2, W, A2, D, S1, A1, E2, B, Y1, Z1, T, Z, R1, S, J1, B2, A, Q1, Y does not change the dependency between N1 and R.

 Does B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O activate any previously blocked path between M1 and K1?
--------------------------------
A. Yes - conditioning on B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O changes the dependency between M1 and K1. Before observing B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O, they were d-separated. After observing all evidence, they are d-connected. This happens because G2 is a common effect (collider) of M1 and K1. Observing G2 opens the path: unknown path.
--------------------------------
B. Yes - conditioning on B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O changes the dependency between M1 and K1. Before observing B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O, they were d-separated. After observing all evidence, they are d-connected. This happens because G2 is a common cause of M1 and K1. Observing G2 blocks the path by conditioning on the common cause: unknown path.
--------------------------------
C. No - conditioning on B1, Q1, Z1, C1, X, X1, C, J, Q, P1, U1, W1, G1, G2, A1, T, F, E, L, D, O does not change the dependency between M1 and K1.

[ERROR] extract_text JSON decode failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0), answer: Based on the previous tool output, there is no successful result to use as input for another tool. The tool output indicated an error due to missing values in the evidence dictionary.

However, I can try to reformulate the original query to better match the available functions. Since we want to know what we believe about node A given some evidence, we can call the get_prob_node_given_any_evidence function with the same parameters as before, but this time making sure to provide a complete evidence dictionary.
