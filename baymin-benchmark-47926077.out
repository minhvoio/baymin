After observing all evidence, they are d-separated. This happens because A is a common cause of B and F2. Observing A blocks the path by conditioning on the common cause.

quiz:
 Does F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M activate any previously blocked path between V1 and L1?
--------------------------------
A. Yes - conditioning on F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M changes the dependency between V1 and L1. Before observing F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M, they were d-separated. After observing all evidence, they are d-connected. This happens because R1 is a common effect (collider) of V1 and L1. Observing R1 opens the path: unknown path.
--------------------------------
B. Yes - conditioning on F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M changes the dependency between V1 and L1. Before observing F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M, they were d-separated. After observing all evidence, they are d-connected. This happens because R1 is a common cause of V1 and L1. Observing R1 blocks the path by conditioning on the common cause: unknown path.
--------------------------------
C. No - conditioning on F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M does not change the dependency between V1 and L1. Before observing F, W, C2, Q, R1, A2, K, G1, Y1, N1, J, N, C1, M, they were d-connected. After observing all evidence, they remain d-separated.
